IVIg also impacts different effector cells of the immune system (B and T lymphocytes, dendritic cells, etc.) and regulates a wide range of genes. Its main mechanism of actions are believed to be Fc-dependent and F(ab')2-dependent. IVIg competitively blocks gamma Fc receptors, preventing the binding and ingestion of phagocytes and suppressing platelet depletion. IVIg contains a number of different antobodies, which prevent infection by attaching to the surface of invading pathogens and aiding in their disposal before they can infect cells. Antibodies remove pathogens via complement activation, agglutination or precipitation, pathogen receptor blocking, macrophage “tagging” or neutralization (via binding) of pathogen toxins. Intact IVIg and F(ab′)2 fragments of IVIg can also neutralize the activity of various autoantibodies.

Insulin binds to the insulin receptor (IR), a heterotetrameric protein consisting of two extracellular alpha units and two transmembrane beta units. The binding of insulin to the alpha subunit of IR stimulates the tyrosine kinase activity intrinsic to the beta subunit of the receptor. The bound receptor is able to autophosphorylate and phosphorylate numerous intracellular substrates such as insulin receptor substrates (IRS) proteins, Cbl, APS, Shc and Gab 1.

The binding activates a Ras-MapK (Map kinase) signaling pathway which leads to the transcriptional activation of many proteins important for cell growth and survival.
DB00040,Glucagon recombinant,CHEMBL266481,"Glucagon binds the glucagon receptor, a G protein-coupled receptor located in the plasma membrane, which then initiates a dual signaling pathway using both adenylate cyclase activation and increased intracellular calcium. Adenylate cyclase manufactures cAMP (cyclic AMP), which activates protein kinase A (cAMP-dependent protein kinase).

DB00046,Insulin Lispro,CHEMBL1201538,"Insulin lispro binds to the insulin receptor (IR), a heterotetrameric protein consisting of two extracellular alpha units and two transmembrane beta units. The binding of insulin to the alpha subunit of IR stimulates the tyrosine kinase activity intrinsic to the beta subunit of the receptor. The bound receptor autophosphorylates and phosphorylates numerous intracellular substrates such as insulin receptor substrates (IRS) proteins, Cbl, APS, Shc and Gab 1. Activation of these proteins leads to the activation of downstream signaling molecules including PI3 kinase and Akt. Akt regulates the activity of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) and protein kinase C (PKC), both of which play critical roles in metabolism and catabolism. In humans, insulin is stored in the form of hexamers; however, only insulin monomers are able to interact with IR. Reversal of the proline and lysine residues at positions B28 and B29 of native insulin eliminates hydrophobic interactions and weakens some of the hydrogen bonds that contribute to the stability of the insulin dimers that comprise insulin hexamers. Hexamers of insulin lispro are produced in the presence of zinc and <i>m</i>-cresol. These weakly associated hexamers quickly dissociate upon subcutaneous injection and are absorbed as monomers through vascular endothelial cells. These properties give insulin lispro its fast-acting properties. "

The bound receptor autophosphorylates and phosphorylates numerous intracellular substrates such as insulin receptor substrates (IRS) proteins, Cbl, APS, Shc and Gab 1. Activation of these proteins leads to the activation of downstream signaling molecules including PI3 kinase and Akt. Akt regulates the activity of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) and protein kinase C (PKC), both of which play critical roles in metabolism. Insulin glargine is completely soluble at pH 4, the pH of administered solution, and has low solubility at physiological pH 7.4. Upon subcuteous injection, the solution is neutralized resulting in the formation of microprecipitates. Small amounts of insulin glargine are released from microprecipitates giving the drug a relatively constant concentration over time profile over 24 hours with no pronounced peak. This release mechanism allows the drug to mimic basal insulin levels within the body. "

DB00058,Alpha-1-proteinase inhibitor,,"Alpha-1 proteinase inhibitor is a serine protease inhibitor (Serpin). Its primary mechanism is inhibiting the action of the serine protease called elastase (also plasmin and thrombin) in the lungs. The reactive center loop (RCL) of alpha-1 proteinase inhibitor extends out from the body of the protein and directs binding to the target protease.

DB00065,Infliximab,CHEMBL1201581,"Infliximab neutralizes the biological activity of TNFa by binding with high affinity to the soluble and transmembrane forms of TNFa and inhibits binding of TNFa with its receptors. Infliximab does not neutralize TNFb (lymphotoxin a), a related cytokine that utilizes the same receptors as TNFa. TNFa activation normally induces the release of proinflammatory cytokines, the enhancement of leukocyte migration and activation of neutrophils among others. Neutralization of the biological activity of TNFa leads to an overall reduction in inflammation."

The binding of vasopressin to the V2 receptor activates adenylate cyclase which causes the release of aquaporin 2 channels into the cells lining the renal medullar duct. This allows water to be reabsorbed down an osmotic gradient so the urine is more concentrated."

DB00080,Daptomycin,CHEMBL387675,"Daptomycin appears to bind or insert into the outer membrane of gram positive bacteria. The binding and integration of daptomycin into the cell membrane is calcium dependent. Calcium ions cause a conformational change in daptomycin, augmenting its amphipathicity (hydrophilic head group and hydrophobic tail group), leading to incorporation into the cell membrane.
This binding causes rapid depolarisation, resulting in a loss of membrane potential leading to inhibition of protein, DNA and RNA synthesis, which results in bacterial cell death. The bactericidal activity of daptomycin is concentration-dependent. There is in vitro evidence of synergy with β-lactam antibiotics.

As a G-CSF analog, it controls proliferation of committed progenitor cells and influences their maturation into mature neutrophils. Filgrastim also stimulates the release of neutrophils from bone marrow storage pools and reduces their maturation time. Filgrastim acts to increase the phagocytic activity of mature neutrophils. In patients receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy, Filgrastim can accelerate neutrophil recovery, leading to a reduction in duration of the neutropenic phase"
DB00100,Coagulation Factor IX (Recombinant),,"Coagulation Factor IX is an important protein in the process of hemostasis and normal blood clotting as it plays a key role within the coagulation cascade. It is located within the blood plasma as a zymogen, an antecedent to enzymatic function, in its inactivated state. Factor IX is dependent on the presence of Vitamin K, and is activated to a serine protease by the function of Coagulation Factor XIa. Factor XIa cleaves the peptide bond associated with protein activation in Factor IX, leaving Factor IX with two exposed chains, a light chain and a heavy chain. These two chains are held together by several disulfide bonds that reinforce the structure of Factor IX's activated form. After being activated, Factor IX forms a complex with calcium ions, membrane phospholipids and Coagulation Factor VIII to activate Coagulation Factor X. The activation of Factor X then performs a similarly integral step in the blood coagulation cascade. The ultimate result of phenotypically normal coagulation factors is the creation of platelets for normal blood clotting."

DB00105,"Interferon Alfa-2b, Recombinant",,Interferon alpha binds to type I interferon receptors (IFNAR1 and IFNAR2c) which upon dimerization activate two Jak (Janus kinase) tyrosine kinases (Jak1 and Tyk2). These transphosphorylate themselves and phosphorylate the receptors. The phosphorylated INFAR receptors then bind to Stat1 and Stat2 (signal transducers and activators of transcription)which dimerize and activate multiple (~100) immunomodulatory and antiviral proteins.

DB00114,Pyridoxal Phosphate,CHEMBL82202,"Pyridoxal Phosphate is a coenzyme of many enzymatic reactions. It is the active form of vitamin B6 which comprises three natural organic compounds, pyridoxal, pyridoxamine and pyridoxine. Pyridoxal phosphate acts as a coenzyme in all transamination reactions, and in some decarboxylation and deamination reactions of amino acids. The aldehyde group of pyridoxal phosphate forms a Schiff-base linkage with the epsilon-amino group of a specific lysine group of the aminotransferase enzyme. The alpha-amino group of the amino acid substrate displaces the epsilon-amino group of the active-site lysine residue. The resulting aldimine becomes deprotonated to become a quinoid intermediate, which in turn accepts a proton at a different position to become a ketimine. The resulting ketimine is hydrolysed so that the amino group remains on the protein complex."
DB00115,Cyanocobalamin,CHEMBL2110563,"Vitamin B12 is used in the body in two forms: Methylcobalamin and 5-deoxyadenosyl cobalamin. The enzyme methionine synthase needs methylcobalamin as a cofactor. This enzyme is involved in the conversion of the amino acid homocysteine into methionine. Methionine in turn is required for DNA methylation. 5-Deoxyadenosyl cobalamin is a cofactor needed by the enzyme that converts L-methylmalonyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA. This conversion is an important step in the extraction of energy from proteins and fats. Furthermore, succinyl CoA is necessary for the production of hemoglobin, the substances that carries oxygen in red blood cells."
DB00116,Tetrahydrofolic acid,CHEMBL2021342,"Tetrahydrofolate is transported across cells by receptor-mediated endocytosis where it is needed to maintain normal erythropoiesis, synthesize purine and thymidylate nucleic acids, interconvert amino acids, methylate tRNA, and generate and use formate."
DB00117,Histidine,CHEMBL17962,"Since the actions of supplemental L-histidine are unclear, any postulated mechanism is entirely speculative. However, some facts are known about L-histidine and some of its metabolites, such as histamine and trans-urocanic acid, which suggest that supplemental L-histidine may one day be shown to have immunomodulatory and/or antioxidant activities. Low free histidine has been found in the serum of some rheumatoid arthritis patients. Serum concentrations of other amino acids have been found to be normal in these patients. L-histidine is an excellent chelating agent for such metals as copper, iron and zinc. Copper and iron participate in a reaction (Fenton reaction) that generates potent reactive oxygen species that could be destructive to tissues, including joints. <br/>L-histidine is the obligate precursor of histamine, which is produced via the decarboxylation of the amino acid. In experimental animals, tissue histamine levels increase as the amount of dietary L-histidine increases. It is likely that this would be the case in humans as well. Histamine is known to possess immunomodulatory and antioxidant activity. Suppressor T cells have H2 receptors, and histamine activates them. Promotion of suppressor T cell activity could be beneficial in rheumatoid arthritis. Further, histamine has been shown to down-regulate the production of reactive oxygen species in phagocytic cells, such as monocytes, by binding to the H2 receptors on these cells. Decreased reactive oxygen species production by phagocytes could play antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory roles in such diseases as rheumatoid arthritis. <br/>This latter mechanism is the rationale for the use of histamine itself in several clinical trials studying histamine for the treatment of certain types of cancer and viral diseases. In these trials, down-regulation by histamine of reactive oxygen species formation appears to inhibit the suppression of natural killer (NK) cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes, allowing these cells to be more effective in attacking cancer cells and virally infected cells."
DB00118,Ademetionine,CHEMBL1088977,"S-Adenosylmethionine (SAMe) is a natural substance present in the cells of the body. It is a direct metabolite of the essential amino acid L-methionine. SAMe plays a crucial biochemical role in the body by donating a one-carbon methyl group in a process called transmethylation. SAMe, formed from the reaction of L-methionine and adenosine triphosphate catalyzed by the enzyme S-adenosylmethionine synthetase, is the methyl-group donor in the biosynthesis of both DNA and RNA nucleic acids, phospholipids, proteins, epinephrine, melatonin, creatine and other molecules."
DB00119,Pyruvic acid,CHEMBL1162144,"Pyruvate serves as a biological fuel by being converted to acetyl coenzyme A, which enters the tricarboxylic acid or Krebs cycle where it is metabolized to produce ATP aerobically. Energy can also be obtained anaerobically from pyruvate via its conversion to lactate. Pyruvate injections or perfusions increase contractile function of hearts when metabolizing glucose or fatty acids. This inotropic effect is striking in hearts stunned by ischemia/reperfusion. The inotropic effect of pyruvate requires intracoronary infusion. Among possible mechanisms for this effect are increased generation of ATP and an increase in ATP phosphorylation potential. Another is activation of pyruvate dehydrogenase, promoting its own oxidation by inhibiting pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase. Pyruvate dehydrogenase is inactivated in ischemia myocardium. Yet another is reduction of cytosolic inorganic phosphate concentration. Pyruvate, as an antioxidant, is known to scavenge such reactive oxygen species as hydrogen peroxide and lipid peroxides. Indirectly, supraphysiological levels of pyruvate may increase cellular reduced glutathione."
DB00120,L-Phenylalanine,CHEMBL301523,The mechanism of L-phenylalanine's putative antidepressant activity may be accounted for by its precursor role in the synthesis of the neurotransmitters norepinephrine and dopamine. Elevated brain norepinephrine and dopamine levels are thought to be associated with antidepressant effects. <br/>The mechanism of L-phenylalanine's possible antivitiligo activity is not well understood. It is thought that L-phenylalanine may stimulate the production of melanin in the affected skin
DB00121,Biotin,CHEMBL857,"Biotin is necessary for the proper functioning of enzymes that transport carboxyl units and fix carbon dioxide, and is required for various metabolic functions, including gluconeogenesis, lipogenesis, fatty acid biosynthesis, propionate metabolism, and catabolism of branched-chain amino acids."
DB00122,Choline,CHEMBL920,"Choline is a major part of the polar head group of phosphatidylcholine. Phosphatidylcholine's role in the maintenance of cell membrane integrity is vital to all of the basic biological processes: information flow, intracellular communication and bioenergetics. Inadequate choline intake would negatively affect all these processes. Choline is also a major part of another membrane phospholipid, sphingomyelin, also important for the maintenance of cell structure and function. It is noteworthy and not surprising that choline deficiency in cell culture causes apoptosis or programmed cell death. This appears to be due to abnormalities in cell membrane phosphatidylcholine content and an increase in ceramide, a precursor, as well as a metabolite, of sphingomyelin. Ceramide accumulation, which is caused by choline deficiency, appears to activate Caspase, a type of enzyme that mediates apoptosis. Betaine or trimethylglycine is derived from choline via an oxidation reaction. Betaine is one of the factors that maintains low levels of homocysteine by resynthesizing L-methionine from homocysteine. Elevated homocysteine levels are a significant risk factor for atherosclerosis, as well as other cardiovascular and neurological disorders. Acetylcholine is one of the major neurotransmitters and requires choline for its synthesis. Adequate acetylcholine levels in the brain are believed to be protective against certain types of dementia, including Alzheimer's disease."
DB00123,L-Lysine,CHEMBL8085,"Proteins of the herpes simplex virus are rich in L-arginine, and tissue culture studies indicate an enhancing effect on viral replication when the amino acid ratio of L-arginine to L-lysine is high in the tissue culture media. When the ratio of L-lysine to L-arginine is high, viral replication and the cytopathogenicity of herpes simplex virus have been found to be inhibited. L-lysine may facilitate the absorption of calcium from the small intestine."
DB00125,L-Arginine,CHEMBL1485,"Many of supplemental L-arginine's activities, including its possible anti-atherogenic actions, may be accounted for by its role as the precursor to nitric oxide or NO. NO is produced by all tissues of the body and plays very important roles in the cardiovascular system, immune system and nervous system. NO is formed from L-arginine via the enzyme nitric oxide synthase or synthetase (NOS), and the effects of NO are mainly mediated by 3,'5' -cyclic guanylate or cyclic GMP. NO activates the enzyme guanylate cyclase, which catalyzes the synthesis of cyclic GMP from guanosine triphosphate or GTP. Cyclic GMP is converted to guanylic acid via the enzyme cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase. NOS is a heme-containing enzyme with some sequences similar to cytochrome P-450 reductase. Several isoforms of NOS exist, two of which are constitutive and one of which is inducible by immunological stimuli. The constitutive NOS found in the vascular endothelium is designated eNOS and that present in the brain, spinal cord and peripheral nervous system is designated nNOS. The form of NOS induced by immunological or inflammatory stimuli is known as iNOS. iNOS may be expressed constitutively in select tissues such as lung epithelium. All the nitric oxide synthases use NADPH (reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate) and oxygen (O2) as cosubstrates, as well as the cofactors FAD (flavin adenine dinucleotide), FMN (flavin mononucleotide), tetrahydrobiopterin and heme. Interestingly, ascorbic acid appears to enhance NOS activity by increasing intracellular tetrahydrobiopterin. eNOS and nNOS synthesize NO in response to an increased concentration of calcium ions or in some cases in response to calcium-independent stimuli, such as shear stress. In vitro studies of NOS indicate that the Km of the enzyme for L-arginine is in the micromolar range. The concentration of L-arginine in endothelial cells, as well as in other cells, and in plasma is in the millimolar range. What this means is that, under physiological conditions, NOS is saturated with its L-arginine substrate. In other words, L-arginine would not be expected to be rate-limiting for the enzyme, and it would not appear that supraphysiological levels of L-arginine which could occur with oral supplementation of the amino acid^would make any difference with regard to NO production. The reaction would appear to have reached its maximum level. However, in vivo studies have demonstrated that, under certain conditions, e.g. hypercholesterolemia, supplemental L-arginine could enhance endothelial-dependent vasodilation and NO production."
DB00126,Vitamin C,CHEMBL196,"In humans, an exogenous source of ascorbic acid is required for collagen formation and tissue repair by acting as a cofactor in the posttranslational formation of 4-hydroxyproline in -Xaa-Pro-Gly- sequences in collagens and other proteins. Ascorbic acid is reversibly oxidized to dehydroascorbic acid in the body. These two forms of the vitamin are believed to be important in oxidation-reduction reactions. The vitamin is involved in tyrosine metabolism, conversion of folic acid to folinic acid, carbohydrate metabolism, synthesis of lipids and proteins, iron metabolism, resistance to infections, and cellular respiration."
DB00127,Spermine,CHEMBL23194,"Spermine is derived from spermidine by spermine synthase. Spermine is a polyamine, a small organic cations that is absolutely required for eukaryotic cell growth. Spermine, is normally found in millimolar concentrations in the nucleus. Spermine functions directly as a free radical scavenger, and forms a variety of adducts that prevent oxidative damage to DNA. Oxidative damage to DNA by reactive oxygen species is a continual problem that cells must guard against to survive. Hence, spermine is a major natural intracellular compound capable of protecting DNA from free radical attack. Spermine is also implicated in the regulation of gene expression, the stabilization of chromatin, and the prevention of endonuclease-mediated DNA fragmentation."
DB00128,L-Aspartic Acid,CHEMBL274323,"There are also claims that L-aspartate has ergogenic effects, that it enhances performance in both prolonged exercise and short intensive exercise. It is hypothesized that L-aspartate, especially the potassium magnesium aspartate salt, spares stores of muscle glycogen and/or promotes a faster rate of glycogen resynthesis during exercise. It has also been hypothesized that L-aspartate can enhance short intensive exercise by serving as a substrate for energy production in the Krebs cycle and for stimulating the purine nucleotide cycle."
DB00129,Ornithine,CHEMBL446143,"L-Ornithine is metabolised to L-arginine. L-arginine stimulates the pituitary release of growth hormone. Burns or other injuries affect the state of L-arginine in tissues throughout the body. As De novo synthesis of L-arginine during these conditions is usually not sufficient for normal immune function, nor for normal protein synthesis, L-ornithine may have immunomodulatory and wound-healing activities under these conditions (by virtue of its metabolism to L-arginine)."
DB00130,L-Glutamine,CHEMBL930,"Supplemental L-glutamine's possible immunomodulatory role may be accounted for in a number of ways. L-glutamine appears to play a major role in protecting the integrity of the gastrointestinal tract and, in particular, the large intestine. During catabolic states, the integrity of the intestinal mucosa may be compromised with consequent increased intestinal permeability and translocation of Gram-negative bacteria from the large intestine into the body. The demand for L-glutamine by the intestine, as well as by cells such as lymphocytes, appears to be much greater than that supplied by skeletal muscle, the major storage tissue for L-glutamine. L-glutamine is the preferred respiratory fuel for enterocytes, colonocytes and lymphocytes. Therefore, supplying supplemental L-glutamine under these conditions may do a number of things. For one, it may reverse the catabolic state by sparing skeletal muscle L-glutamine. It also may inhibit translocation of Gram-negative bacteria from the large intestine. L-glutamine helps maintain secretory IgA, which functions primarily by preventing the attachment of bacteria to mucosal cells. L-glutamine appears to be required to support the proliferation of mitogen-stimulated lymphocytes, as well as the production of interleukin-2 (IL-2) and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma). It is also required for the maintenance of lymphokine-activated killer cells (LAK). L-glutamine can enhance phagocytosis by neutrophils and monocytes. It can lead to an increased synthesis of glutathione in the intestine, which may also play a role in maintaining the integrity of the intestinal mucosa by ameliorating oxidative stress. The exact mechanism of the possible immunomodulatory action of supplemental L-glutamine, however, remains unclear. It is conceivable that the major effect of L-glutamine occurs at the level of the intestine. Perhaps enteral L-glutamine acts directly on intestine-associated lymphoid tissue and stimulates overall immune function by that mechanism, without passing beyond the splanchnic bed.

The exact mechanism of L-glutamine's effect on NAD redox potential is unknown but is thought to involve increased amounts of reduced glutathione made available by glutamine supplementation [FDA Label]. This improvement in redox potential reduces the amount of oxidative damage which sickle red blood cells are more susceptible to. The reduction in cellular damage is thought to reduce chronic hemolysis and vaso-occlusive events."
DB00131,Adenosine monophosphate,CHEMBL752,"Nucleotides such as Adenosine-5'-Monophosphate affect a number of immune functions, including the reversal of malnutrition and starvation-induced immunosuppression, the enhancement of T-cell maturation and function, the enhancement of natural killer cell activity, the improvement of delayed cutaneous hypersensitivity, helping resistance to such infectious agents as Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans, and finally the modulation of T-cell responses toward type 1 CD4 helper lymphocytes or Th1 cells. Studies have shown that mice fed a nucleotide-free diet have both impaired humoral and cellular immune responses. The addition of dietary nucleotides normalizes both types of responses. RNA, a delivery form of nucleotides, and ribonucleotides were used in these studies. The mechanism of the immune-enhancing activity of nucleic acids/nucleotides is not clear."
DB00132,Alpha-Linolenic Acid,CHEMBL8739,"Alpha Linolenic Acid or ALA is considered an essential fatty acid because it is required for human health, but cannot be synthesized by humans. It is in fact  a plant-derived fatty acid. Humans can synthesize other omega-3 fatty acids from ALA, including eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). EPA is a precursor of the series-3 prostaglandins, the series-5 leukotrienes and the series-3 thromboxanes. These eicosanoids have anti-inflammatory and anti-atherogenic properties. ALA metabolites may also inhibit the production of the pro-inflammatory eicosanoids, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and leukotriene B4 (LTB4), as well as the pro-inflammatory cytokines, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta). Omega-3 fatty acids like ALA and its byproducts can modulate the expression of a number of genes, including those involved with fatty acid metabolism and inflammation. They regulate gene expression through their effects on the activity of transcription factors including NF-kappa B and members of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) family. Incorporation of ALA and its metabolites in cell membranes can affect membrane fluidity and may play a role in anti-inflammatory activity, inhibition of platelet aggregation and possibly in anti-proliferative actions of ALA. ALA is first metabolized by delta6 desaturease into steridonic acid."
DB00133,Serine,CHEMBL11298,"L-Serine plays a role in cell growth and development (cellular proliferation). The conversion of L-serine to glycine by serine hydroxymethyltransferase results in the formation of the one-carbon units necessary for the synthesis of the purine bases, adenine and guanine. These bases when linked to the phosphate ester of pentose sugars are essential components of DNA and RNA and the end products of energy producing metabolic pathways, ATP and GTP. In addition, L-serine conversion to glycine via this same enzyme provides the one-carbon units necessary for production of the pyrimidine nucleotide, deoxythymidine monophosphate, also an essential component of DNA."
DB00134,L-Methionine,CHEMBL42336,"The mechanism of the possible anti-hepatotoxic activity of L-methionine is not entirely clear. It is thought that metabolism of high doses of acetaminophen in the liver lead to decreased levels of hepatic glutathione and increased oxidative stress. L-methionine is a precursor to L-cysteine. L-cysteine itself may have antioxidant activity. L-cysteine is also a precursor to the antioxidant glutathione. Antioxidant activity of L-methionine and metabolites of L-methionine appear to account for its possible anti-hepatotoxic activity. Recent research suggests that methionine itself has free-radical scavenging activity by virtue of its sulfur, as well as its chelating ability."
DB00135,L-Tyrosine,CHEMBL925,"Tyrosine is produced in cells by hydroxylating the essential amino acid phenylalanine. This relationship is much like that between cysteine and methionine. Half of the phenylalanine required goes into the production of tyrosine; if the diet is rich in tyrosine itself, the requirements for phenylalanine are reduced by about 50%. The mechanism of L-tyrosine's antidepressant activity can be accounted for by the precursor role of L-tyrosine in the synthesis of the neurotransmitters norepinephrine and dopamine. Elevated brain norepinephrine and dopamine levels are thought to be associated with antidepressant effects."
DB00136,Calcitriol,CHEMBL846,"The mechanism of action of calcitriol in the treatment of psoriasis is accounted for by their antiproliferative activity for keratinocytes and their stimulation of epidermal cell differentiation. The anticarcinogenic activity of the active form of Calcitriol appears to be correlated with cellular vitamin D receptor (VDR) levels. Vitamin D receptors belong to the superfamily of steroid-hormone zinc-finger receptors. VDRs selectively bind 1,25-(OH)<sub>2</sub>-D3 and retinoic acid X receptor (RXR) to form a heterodimeric complex that interacts with specific DNA sequences known as vitamin D-responsive elements. VDRs are ligand-activated transcription factors. The receptors activate or repress the transcription of target genes upon binding their respective ligands. It is thought that the anticarcinogenic effect of Calcitriol is mediated via VDRs in cancer cells. The immunomodulatory activity of calcitriol is thought to be mediated by vitamin D receptors (VDRs) which are expressed constitutively in monocytes but induced upon activation of T and B lymphocytes. 1,25-(OH)<sub>2</sub>-D3 has also been found to enhance the activity of some vitamin D-receptor positive immune cells and to enhance the sensitivity of certain target cells to various cytokines secreted by immune cells."
DB00137,Lutein,CHEMBL173929,"Xanthophylls have antioxidant activity and react with active oxygen species, producing biologically active degradation products. They also can inhibit peroxidation of membrane phospholipids and reduce lipofuscin formation, both of which contribute to their antioxidant properties. Lutein is naturally present in the macula of the human retina. It filters out potentially phototoxic blue light and near-ultraviolet radiation from the macula. The protective effect is due in part, to the reactive oxygen species quenching ability of these carotenoids. Lutein is more stable to decomposition by pro-oxidants than are other carotenoids such as beta-carotene and lycopene. Lutein is abundant in the region surrounding the fovea, and lutein is the predominant pigment at the outermost periphery of the macula. Zeaxanthin, which is fully conjugated (lutein is not), may offer somewhat better protection than lutein against phototoxic damage caused by blue and near-ultraviolet light radiation. Lutein is one of only two carotenoids that have been identified in the human lens, may be protective against age-related increases in lens density and cataract formation. Again, the possible protection afforded by lutein may be accounted for, in part, by its reactive oxygen species scavenging abilities. Carotenoids also provide protection from cancer. One of the mechanisms of this is by increasing the expression of the protein connexin-43, thereby stimulating gap junctional communication and preventing unrestrained cell proliferation."
DB00138,Cystine,CHEMBL590540,"Certain conditions, e.g. an acetaminophen overdose, deplete hepatic glutathione and subject the tissues to oxidative stress resulting in loss of cellular integrity. L-Cystine serves as a major precursor for synthesis of glutathione."
DB00139,Succinic acid,CHEMBL576,"Succinate is an essential component of the Krebs or citric acid cycle and serves an electron donor in the production of fumaric acid and FADH2. It also has been shown to be a good ""natural"" antibiotic because of its relative acidic or caustic nature (high concentrations can even cause burns). Succinate supplements have been shown to help reduce the effects of hangovers by activating the degradation of acetaldehyde - a toxic byproduct of alcohol metabolism - into CO2 and H2O through aerobic metabolism. Succinic acid has been shown to stimulate neural system recovery and bolster the immune system. Claims have also been made that it boosts awareness, concentration and reflexes."
DB00140,Riboflavin,CHEMBL1534,"Binds to riboflavin hydrogenase, riboflavin kinase, and riboflavin synthase. Riboflavin is the precursor of flavin mononucleotide (FMN, riboflavin monophosphate) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD). The antioxidant activity of riboflavin is principally derived from its role as a precursor of FAD and the role of this cofactor in the production of the antioxidant reduced glutathione. Reduced glutathione is the cofactor of the selenium-containing glutathione peroxidases among other things. The glutathione peroxidases are major antioxidant enzymes. Reduced glutathione is generated by the FAD-containing enzyme glutathione reductase."
DB00141,N-Acetylglucosamine,CHEMBL447878,"The mechanism of action in relieving arthritic pain and in repair of cartilage is a matter of speculation. Biochemically, glucosamine is involved in glycoprotein metabolism. Glycoproteins, known as proteoglycans, form the ground substance in the extra-cellular matrix of connective tissue. Proteoglycans are polyanionic substances of high-molecular weight and contain many different types of heteropolysaccharide side-chains covalently linked to a polypeptide-chain backbone. These polysaccharides make up to 95% of the proteoglycan structure. In fact, chemically, proteoglycans resemble polysaccharides more than they do proteins. The polysaccharide groups in proteoglycans are called glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). GAGs include hyaluronic acid, chondroitin sulfate, dermatan sulfate, keratan sulfate, heparin and heparan sulfate. All of the GAGs contain derivatives of glucosamine or galactosamine. Glucosamine derivatives are found in hyaluronic acid, keratan sulfate and heparan sulfate. Chondroitin sulfate contains derivatives of galactosamine. The glucosamine-containing glycosaminoglycan hyaluronic acid is vital for the function of articular cartilage. GAG chains are fundamental components of aggrecan found in articular cartilage. Aggrecan confers upon articular cartilage shock-absorbing properties. It does this by providing cartilage with a swelling pressure that is restrained by the tensile forces of collagen fibers. This balance confers upon articular cartilage the deformable resilience vital to its function. In the early stages of degenerative joint disease, aggrecan biosynthesis is increased. However, in later stages, aggrecan synthesis is decreased, leading eventually to the loss of cartilage resiliency and to most of the symptoms that accompany osteoarthritis. During the progression of osteoarthritis, exogenous glucosamine may have a beneficial role. It is known that, in vitro, chondrocytes do synthesize more aggregan when the culture medium is supplemented with glucosamine. N-acetylglucosamine is found to be less effective in these in vitro studies. Glucosamine has also been found to have antioxidant activity and to be beneficial in animal models of experimental arthritis. The counter anion of the glucosamine salt (i.e. chloride or sulfate) is unlikely to play any role in the action or pharmacokinetics of glucosamine. Further, the sulfate in glucosamine sulfate supplements should not be confused with the glucosamine sulfate found in such GAGs as keratan sulfate and heparan sulfate. In the case of the supplement, sulfate is the anion of the salt. In the case of the above GAGs, sulfate is present as an ester. Also, there is no glucosamine sulfate in chondroitin sulfate (source: PDRhealth)."
DB00142,Glutamic Acid,CHEMBL575060,"Glutamate activates both ionotropic and metabotropic glutamate receptors. The ionotropic ones being non-NMDA (AMPA and kainate) and NMDA receptors. Free glutamic acid cannot cross the blood-brain barrier in appreciable quantities; instead it is converted into L-glutamine, which the brain uses for fuel and protein synthesis. It is conjectured that glutamate is involved in cognitive functions like learning and memory in the brain, though excessive amounts may cause neuronal damage associated in diseases like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, lathyrism, and Alzheimer's disease. Also, the drug phencyclidine (more commonly known as PCP) antagonizes glutamate at the NMDA receptor, causing behavior reminiscent of schizophrenia. Glutamate in action is extremely difficult to study due to its transient nature."
DB00143,Glutathione,CHEMBL1543,"Glutathione (GSH) participates in leukotriene synthesis and is a cofactor for the enzyme glutathione peroxidase. It is also important as a hydrophilic molecule that is added to lipophilic toxins and waste in the liver during biotransformation before they can become part of the bile. Glutathione is also needed for the detoxification of methylglyoxal, a toxin produced as a by-product of metabolism. This detoxification reaction is carried out by the glyoxalase system. Glyoxalase I catalyzes the conversion of methylglyoxal and reduced glutathione to S-D-Lactoyl-glutathione. Glyoxalase II catalyzes the conversion of S-D-Lactoyl Glutathione to Reduced Glutathione and D-lactate. GSH is known as a cofactor in both conjugation reactions and reduction reactions, catalyzed by glutathione S-transferase enzymes in cytosol, microsomes, and mitochondria. However, it is capable of participating in non-enzymatic conjugation with some chemicals, as it is hypothesized to do to a significant extent with n-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI), the reactive cytochrome P450 reactive metabolite formed by toxic overdose of acetaminophen. Glutathione in this capacity binds to NAPQI as a suicide substrate and in the process detoxifies it, taking the place of cellular protein sulfhydryl groups which would otherwise be toxically adducted. The preferred medical treatment to an overdose of this nature, whose efficacy has been consistently supported in literature, is the administration (usually in atomized form) of N-acetylcysteine, which is used by cells to replace spent GSSG and allow a usable GSH pool."
DB00144,Phosphatidyl serine,,"Cholinergic hypofunction is thought to account in part for the cognitive deficits found in Alzheimer's disease. The most commonly used drugs for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease are reversible acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. The rationale of these drugs is to increase acetylcholine levels in the brains of Alzheimer's patients, and they may be somewhat effective in some cases. Phosphatidylserine restores acetylcholine release in aging humans by maintaining an adequate supply of the molecule and is able to increase the availability of endogenous choline for de novo acetylcholine synthesis. The hippocampus of the brain is believed to be important for cognitive processes and is affected in those with Alzheimer's disease. The dendritic spines of pyramidal cells, the post-synaptic target of the excitatory input to the hippocampus, have been proposed as a substrate for information storage. Age-dependent dendritic spine loss in pyramidal neurons has been reported in the human brain, and the extent of synaptic loss appears to correlate with the degree of cognitive impairment. Phosphatidylserine treatment prevents the age-related reduction in dendritic spine density in rat hippocampus. Protein kinase C facilitation of acetylcholine release has been reported in rats. Phosphatidylserine was found to restore protein kinase C activity in aging rats. Stimulation of calcium uptake by brain synaptosomes and activation of protein kinase C are yet other speculative mechanisms of phosphatidylserine's putative cognition-enhancing action."
DB00145,Glycine,CHEMBL773,"In the CNS, there exist strychnine-sensitive glycine binding sites as well as strychnine-insensitive glycine binding sites. The strychnine-insensitive glycine-binding site is located on the NMDA receptor complex. The strychnine-sensitive glycine receptor complex is comprised of a chloride channel and is a member of the ligand-gated ion channel superfamily. The putative antispastic activity of supplemental glycine could be mediated by glycine's binding to strychnine-sensitive binding sites in the spinal cord. This would result in increased chloride conductance and consequent enhancement of inhibitory neurotransmission. The ability of glycine to potentiate NMDA receptor-mediated neurotransmission raised the possibility of its use in the management of neuroleptic-resistant negative symptoms in schizophrenia. <br/>Animal studies indicate that supplemental glycine protects against endotoxin-induced lethality, hypoxia-reperfusion injury after liver transplantation, and D-galactosamine-mediated liver injury. Neutrophils are thought to participate in these pathologic processes via invasion of tissue and releasing such reactive oxygen species as superoxide. In vitro studies have shown that neutrophils contain a glycine-gated chloride channel that can attenuate increases in intracellular calcium and diminsh neutrophil oxidant production. This research is ealy-stage, but suggests that supplementary glycine may turn out to be useful in processes where neutrophil infiltration contributes to toxicity, such as ARDS."
DB00146,Calcidiol,CHEMBL1040,"Calcidiol is transformed in the kidney by 25-hydroxyvitamin D3-1-(alpha)-hydroxylase to calcitriol, the active form of vitamin D3. Calcitriol binds to intracellular receptors that then function as transcription factors to modulate gene expression. Like the receptors for other steroid hormones and thyroid hormones, the vitamin D receptor has hormone-binding and DNA-binding domains. The vitamin D receptor forms a complex with another intracellular receptor, the retinoid-X receptor, and that heterodimer is what binds to DNA. In most cases studied, the effect is to activate transcription, but situations are also known in which vitamin D suppresses transcription. Calcitriol increases the serum calcium concentrations by: increasing GI absorption of phosphorus and calcium, increasing osteoclastic resorption, and increasing distal renal tubular reabsorption of calcium. Calcitriol appears to promote intestinal absorption of calcium through binding to the vitamin D receptor in the mucosal cytoplasm of the intestine. Subsequently, calcium is absorbed through formation of a calcium-binding protein."
DB00147,Pyridoxal,CHEMBL102970,"Pyridoxal is the precursor to pyridoxal phosphate. Pyridoxal 5'-phosphate is involved in a wide range of biochemical reactions, including the metabolism of amino acids and glycogen, the synthesis of nucleic acids, hemogloblin, sphingomyelin and other sphingolipids, and the synthesis of the neurotransmitters serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)."
DB00148,Creatine,CHEMBL283800,"In the muscles, a fraction of the total creatine binds to phosphate - forming creatine phosphate. The reaction is catalysed by creatine kinase, and the result is phosphocreatine (PCr). Phosphocreatine binds with adenosine diphosphate to convert it back to ATP (adenosine triphosphate), an important cellular energy source for short term ATP needs prior to oxidative phosphorylation."
DB00149,L-Leucine,CHEMBL291962,"This group of essential amino acids are identified as the branched-chain amino acids, BCAAs. Because this arrangement of carbon atoms cannot be made by humans, these amino acids are an essential element in the diet. The catabolism of all three compounds initiates in muscle and yields NADH and FADH2 which can be utilized for ATP generation. The catabolism of all three of these amino acids uses the same enzymes in the first two steps. The first step in each case is a transamination using a single BCAA aminotransferase, with a-ketoglutarate as amine acceptor. As a result, three different a-keto acids are produced and are oxidized using a common branched-chain a-keto acid dehydrogenase, yielding the three different CoA derivatives. Subsequently the metabolic pathways diverge, producing many intermediates. The principal product from valine is propionylCoA, the glucogenic precursor of succinyl-CoA. Isoleucine catabolism terminates with production of acetylCoA and propionylCoA; thus isoleucine is both glucogenic and ketogenic. Leucine gives rise to acetylCoA and acetoacetylCoA, and is thus classified as strictly ketogenic. There are a number of genetic diseases associated with faulty catabolism of the BCAAs. The most common defect is in the branched-chain a-keto acid dehydrogenase. Since there is only one dehydrogenase enzyme for all three amino acids, all three a-keto acids accumulate and are excreted in the urine. The disease is known as Maple syrup urine disease because of the characteristic odor of the urine in afflicted individuals. Mental retardation in these cases is extensive. Unfortunately, since these are essential amino acids, they cannot be heavily restricted in the diet; ultimately, the life of afflicted individuals is short and development is abnormal The main neurological problems are due to poor formation of myelin in the CNS."
DB00150,L-Tryptophan,CHEMBL54976,"A number of important side reactions occur during the catabolism of tryptophan on the pathway to acetoacetate. The first enzyme of the catabolic pathway is an iron porphyrin oxygenase that opens the indole ring. The latter enzyme is highly inducible, its concentration rising almost 10-fold on a diet high in tryptophan. Kynurenine is the first key branch point intermediate in the pathway. Kynurenine undergoes deamniation in a standard transamination reaction yielding kynurenic acid. Kynurenic acid and metabolites have been shown to act as antiexcitotoxics and anticonvulsives. A second side branch reaction produces anthranilic acid plus alanine. Another equivalent of alanine is produced further along the main catabolic pathway, and it is the production of these alanine residues that allows tryptophan to be classified among the glucogenic and ketogenic amino acids. The second important branch point converts kynurenine into 2-amino-3-carboxymuconic semialdehyde, which has two fates. The main flow of carbon elements from this intermediate is to glutarate. An important side reaction in liver is a transamination and several rearrangements to produce limited amounts of nicotinic acid, which leads to production of a small amount of NAD<sup>+</sup> and NADP<sup>+</sup>."
DB00151,L-Cysteine,CHEMBL863,"Although classified as a non-essential amino acid cysteine may be essential for infants, the elderly, and individuals with certain metabolic disease or who suffer from malabsorption syndromes. Cysteine can usually be synthesized by the human body under normal physiological conditions if a sufficient quantity of methionine is available. Due to the ability of thiols to undergo redox reactions, cysteine has antioxidant properties. Cysteine's antioxidant properties are typically expressed in the tripeptide glutathione, which occurs in humans as well as other organisms. The systemic availability of oral glutathione (GSH) is negligible; so it must be biosynthesized from its constituent amino acids, cysteine, glycine, and glutamic acid. Glutamic acid and glycine are readily available in the diets of most industrialized countries, but the availability of cysteine can be the limiting substrate. Cysteine is also an important source of sulfide in human metabolism. The sulfide in iron-sulfur clusters and in nitrogenase is extracted from cysteine, which is converted to alanine in the process. In a 1994 report released by five top cigarette companies, cysteine is one of the 599 additives to cigarettes. Its use or purpose, however, is unknown, like most cigarette additives. Its inclusion in cigarettes could offer two benefits: Acting as an expectorant, since smoking increases mucus production in the lungs; and increasing the beneficial antioxidant glutathione (which is diminished in smokers)."
DB00152,Thiamine,CHEMBL1547,"It is thought that the mechanism of action of thiamine on endothelial cells is related to a reduction in intracellular protein glycation by redirecting the glycolytic flux. Thiamine is mainly the transport form of the vitamin, while the active forms are phosphorylated thiamine derivatives. There are five known natural thiamine phosphate derivatives: thiamine monophosphate (ThMP), thiamine diphosphate (ThDP), also sometimes called thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP), thiamine triphosphate (ThTP), and the recently discovered adenosine thiamine triphosphate (AThTP), and adenosine thiamine diphosphate. Each derivative has unique functions, however, most are involved as coenzymes."
DB00153,Ergocalciferol,CHEMBL1536,"Activated ergocalciferol increases serum calcium and phosphate concentrations, primarily by increasing intestinal absorption of calcium and phosphate through binding to a specific receptor in the mucosal cytoplasm of the intestine. Subsequently, calcium is absorbed through formation of a calcium-binding protein. 25-hydroxyergocalciferol  is the intermediary metabolite of ergocalciferol. Although this metabolite exhibits  2–5 times more activity than unactivated  ergocalciferol in curing rickets and inducing calcium absorption and mobilization (from bone) in animals, this increased activity is still insufficient to affect these functions at physiologic concentrations.  Activated ergocalciferol stimulate resorption of bone and are required for normal mineralization of bone. Physiological doses of ergocalciferol also promotes calcium reabsorption by the kidneys, but the significance of this effect is not known. "
DB00154,Dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid,CHEMBL465183,"DHLA (or DGLA) is a precursor in the synthesis of prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) as well as the series-3 prostaglandins. It also serves as a precursor in the synthesis of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). EPA is a precursor of the series-3 prostaglandins, the series-5 leukotrienes and the series-3 thromboxanes. These eicosanoids have anti-thrombogenic, anti-inflammatory and anti-atherogenic properties. PGE1 inhibits platelet aggregation and has a vasodilation action. DHLA has also been shown to reduce the production/activity of tumor necrosis factor alpha."
DB00155,L-Citrulline,CHEMBL444814,"L-citrulline is converted to L-arginine by argininosuccinate synthase. L-arginine is in turn responsible for citrulline's therapeutic affects. Many of L-arginine's activities, including its possible anti-atherogenic actions, may be accounted for by its role as the precursor to nitric oxide or NO. NO is produced by all tissues of the body and plays very important roles in the cardiovascular system, immune system and nervous system. NO is formed from L-arginine via the enzyme nitric oxide synthase or synthetase (NOS), and the effects of NO are mainly mediated by 3',5' -cyclic guanylate or cyclic GMP. NO activates the enzyme guanylate cyclase, which catalyzes the synthesis of cyclic GMP from guanosine triphosphate or GTP. Cyclic GMP is converted to guanylic acid via the enzyme cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase. <br/><br/>NOS is a heme-containing enzyme with some sequences similar to cytochrome P-450 reductase. Several isoforms of NOS exist, two of which are constitutive and one of which is inducible by immunological stimuli. The constitutive NOS found in the vascular endothelium is designated eNOS and that present in the brain, spinal cord and peripheral nervous system is designated nNOS. The form of NOS induced by immunological or inflammatory stimuli is known as iNOS. iNOS may be expressed constitutively in select tissues such as lung epithelium. <br/><br/>All the nitric oxide synthases use NADPH (reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate) and oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) as cosubstrates, as well as the cofactors FAD (flavin adenine dinucleotide), FMN (flavin mononucleotide), tetrahydrobiopterin and heme. Interestingly, ascorbic acid appears to enhance NOS activity by increasing intracellular tetrahydrobiopterin. eNOS and nNOS synthesize NO in response to an increased concentration of calcium ions or in some cases in response to calcium-independent stimuli, such as shear stress. <i>In vitro</i> studies of NOS indicate that the Km of the enzyme for L-arginine is in the micromolar range. The concentration of L-arginine in endothelial cells, as well as in other cells, and in plasma is in the millimolar range. What this means is that, under physiological conditions, NOS is saturated with its L-arginine substrate. In other words, L-arginine would not be expected to be rate-limiting for the enzyme, and it would not appear that supraphysiological levels of L-arginine which could occur with oral supplementation of the amino acid would make any difference with regard to NO production. The reaction would appear to have reached its maximum level. However, <i>in vivo</i> studies have demonstrated that, under certain conditions, e.g. hypercholesterolemia, L-arginine could enhance endothelial-dependent vasodilation and NO production."
DB00156,L-Threonine,CHEMBL291747,"L-Threonine is a precursor to the amino acids glycine and serine. It acts as a lipotropic in controlling fat build-up in the liver. May help combat mental illness and may be very useful in indigestion and intestinal malfunctions. Also, threonine prevents excessive liver fat. Nutrients are more readily absorbed when threonine is present."
DB00157,NADH,,"NADH is synthesized by the body and thus is not an essential nutrient. It does require the essential nutrient nicotinamide for its synthesis, and its role in energy production is certainly an essential one. In addition to its role in the mitochondrial electron transport chain, NADH is produced in the cytosol. The mitochondrial membrane is impermeable to NADH, and this permeability barrier effectively separates the cytoplasmic from the mitochondrial NADH pools. However, cytoplasmic NADH can be used for biologic energy production. This occurs when the malate-aspartate shuttle introduces reducing equivalents from NADH in the cytosol to the electron transport chain of the mitochondria. This shuttle mainly occurs in the liver and heart."
DB00158,Folic Acid,CHEMBL1622,"Folic acid, as it is biochemically inactive, is converted to tetrahydrofolic acid and methyltetrahydrofolate by dihydrofolate reductase. These folic acid congeners are transported across cells by receptor-mediated endocytosis where they are needed to maintain normal erythropoiesis, synthesize purine and thymidylate nucleic acids, interconvert amino acids, methylate tRNA, and generate and use formate. Using vitamin B12 as a cofactor, folic acid can normalize high homocysteine levels by remethylation of homocysteine to methionine via methionine synthetase."
DB00159,Icosapent,CHEMBL460026,"The anti-inflammatory, antithrombotic and immunomodulatory actions of EPA is probably due to its role in eicosanoid physiology and biochemistry. Most eicosanoids are produced by the metabolism of omega-3 fatty acids, specifically, arachidonic acid. These eicosanoids, leukotriene B4 (LTB4) and thromboxane A2 (TXA2) stimulate leukocyte chemotaxis, platelet aggregation and vasoconstriction. They are thrombogenic and artherogenic. On the other hand, EPA is metabolized to leukotriene B5 (LTB5) and thromboxane A3 (TXA3), which are eicosanoids that promote vasodilation, inhibit platelet aggregation and leukocyte chemotaxis and are anti-artherogenic and anti-thrombotic. The triglyceride-lowering effect of EPA results from inhibition of lipogenesis and stimulation of fatty acid oxidation. Fatty acid oxidation of EPA occurs mainly in the mitochondria. EPA is a substrate for Prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 1 and 2. It also appears to affect the function and bind to the Carbohydrate responsive element binding protein (ChREBP) and to a fatty acid receptor (G-coupled receptor) known as GP40."
DB00160,L-Alanine,CHEMBL279597,"L-Alanine is a non-essential amino acid that occurs in high levels in its free state in plasma. It is produced from pyruvate by transamination. It is involved in sugar and acid metabolism, increases immunity, and provides energy for muscle tissue, brain, and the central nervous system. BCAAs are used as a source of energy for muscle cells. During prolonged exercise, BCAAs are released from skeletal muscles and their carbon backbones are used as fuel, while their nitrogen portion is used to form another amino acid, Alanine. Alanine is then converted to Glucose by the liver. This form of energy production is called the Alanine-Glucose cycle, and it plays a major role in maintaining the body's blood sugar balance."

DB00162,Vitamin A,CHEMBL986,"Vision:Vitamin A (all-<i>trans</i> retinol) is converted in the retina to the 11-<i>cis</i>-isomer of retinaldehyde or 11-<i>cis</i>-retinal. 11-<i>cis</i>-retinal functions in the retina in the transduction of light into the neural signals necessary for vision. 11-<i>cis</i>-retinal, while attached to opsin in rhodopsin is isomerized to all-<i>trans</i>-retinal by light. This is the event that triggers the nerve impulse to the brain which allows for the perception of light. All-<i>trans</i>-retinal is then released from opsin and reduced to all-<i>trans</i>-retinol. All-<i>trans</i>-retinol is isomerized to 11-<i>cis</i>-retinol in the dark, and then oxidized to 11-<i>cis</i>-retinal. 11-<i>cis</i>-retinal recombines with opsin to re-form rhodopsin. Night blindness or defective vision at low illumination results from a failure to re-synthesize 11-<i>cis</i> retinal rapidly. <br/>Epithelial differentiation: The role of Vitamin A in epithelial differentiation, as well as in other physiological processes, involves the binding of Vitamin A to two families of nuclear retinoid receptors (retinoic acid receptors, RARs; and retinoid-X receptors, RXRs). These receptors function as ligand-activated transcription factors that modulate gene transcription. When there is not enough Vitamin A to bind these receptors, natural cell differentiation and growth are interrupted."
DB00163,Vitamin E,CHEMBL47,"Although all forms of Vitamin E exhibit antioxidant activity, it is known that the antioxidant activity of vitamin E is not sufficient to explain the vitamin's biological activity. <br/>Vitamin E's anti-atherogenic activity involves the inhibition of the oxidation of LDL and the accumulation of oxLDL in the arterial wall. It also appears to reduce oxLDL-induced apoptosis in human endothelial cells. Oxidation of LDL is a key early step in atherogenesis as it triggers a number of events which lead to the formation of atherosclerotic plaque. In addition, vitamin E inhibits protein kinase C (PKC) activity. PKC plays a role in smooth muscle cell proliferation, and, thus, the inhibition of PKC results in inhibition of smooth muscle cell proliferation, which is involved in atherogenesis. <br/>Vitamin E's antithrombotic and anticoagulant activities involves the downregulation of the expression of intracellular cell adhesion molecule(ICAM)-1 and vascular cell adhesion molecule(VCAM)-1 which lowers the adhesion of blood components to the endothelium. In addition, vitamin E upregulates the expression of cytosolic phospholipase A2 and cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 which in turn enhances the release of prostacyclin. Prostacyclin is a vasodilating factor and inhibitor of platelet aggregation and platelet release. It is also known that platelet aggregation is mediated by a mechanism involving the binding of fibrinogen to the glycoprotein IIb/IIIa (GPIIb/IIIa) complex of platelets. GPIIb/IIIa is the major membrane receptor protein that is key to the role of the platelet aggregation response. GPIIb is the alpha-subunit of this platelet membrane protein. Alpha-tocopherol downregulates GPIIb promoter activity which results in reduction of GPIIb protein expression and decreased platelet aggregation. Vitamin E has also been found in culture to decrease plasma production of thrombin, a protein which binds to platelets and induces aggregation. A metabolite of vitamin E called vitamin E quinone or alpha-tocopheryl quinone (TQ) is a potent anticoagulant. This metabolite inhibits vitamin K-dependent carboxylase, which is a major enzyme in the coagulation cascade.<br/>The neuroprotective effects of vitamin E are explained by its antioxidant effects. Many disorders of the nervous system are caused by oxidative stress. Vitamin E protects against this stress, thereby protecting the nervouse system. <br/>The immunomodulatory effects of Vitamin E have been demonstrated in vitro, where alpha-tocopherol increases mitogenic response of T lymphocytes from aged mice. The mechanism of this response by vitamin E is not well understood, however it has been suggested that vitamin E itself may have mitogenic activity independent of its antioxidant activity. <br/>Lastly, the mechanism of action of vitamin E's antiviral effects (primarily against HIV-1) involves its antioxidant activity. Vitamin E reduces oxidative stress, which is thought to contribute to HIV-1 pathogenesis, as well as to the pathogenesis of other viral infections. Vitamin E also affects membrane integrity and fluidity and, since HIV-1 is a membraned virus, altering membrane fluidity of HIV-1 may interfere with its ability to bind to cell-receptor sites, thus decreasing its infectivity."
DB00165,Pyridoxine,CHEMBL1364,"Vitamin B6 is the collective term for a group of three related compounds, pyridoxine (PN), pyridoxal (PL) and pyridoxamine (PM), and their phosphorylated derivatives, pyridoxine 5'-phosphate (PNP), pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) and pyridoxamine 5'-phosphate (PMP). Although all six of these compounds should technically be referred to as vitamin B6, the term vitamin B6 is commonly used interchangeably with just one of them, pyridoxine. Vitamin B6, principally in its biologically active coenzyme form pyridoxal 5'-phosphate, is involved in a wide range of biochemical reactions, including the metabolism of amino acids and glycogen, the synthesis of nucleic acids, hemogloblin, sphingomyelin and other sphingolipids, and the synthesis of the neurotransmitters serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)."
DB00166,Lipoic Acid,CHEMBL134342,"Lipoic Acid is generally involved in oxidative decarboxylations of keto acids and is presented as a growth factor for some organisms. Lipoic acid exists as two enantiomers, the R-enantiomer and the S-enantiomer. Normally only the R-enantiomer of an amino acid is biologically active, but for lipoic acid the S-enantiomer assists in the reduction of the R-enantiomer when a racemic mixture is given. Some recent studies have suggested that the S-enantiomer in fact has an inhibiting effect on the R-enantiomer, reducing its biological activity substantially and actually adding to oxidative stress rather than reducing it. Furthermore, the S-enantiomer has been found to reduce the expression of GLUT-4s in cells, responsible for glucose uptake, and hence reduce insulin sensitivity."
DB00167,L-Isoleucine,CHEMBL1233584,"(Applies to Valine, Leucine and Isoleucine) <br/>This group of essential amino acids are identified as the branched-chain amino acids, BCAAs. Because this arrangement of carbon atoms cannot be made by humans, these amino acids are an essential element in the diet. The catabolism of all three compounds initiates in muscle and yields NADH and FADH2 which can be utilized for ATP generation. The catabolism of all three of these amino acids uses the same enzymes in the first two steps. The first step in each case is a transamination using a single BCAA aminotransferase, with a-ketoglutarate as amine acceptor. As a result, three different a-keto acids are produced and are oxidized using a common branched-chain a-keto acid dehydrogenase, yielding the three different CoA derivatives. Subsequently the metabolic pathways diverge, producing many intermediates. <br/>The principal product from valine is propionylCoA, the glucogenic precursor of succinyl-CoA. Isoleucine catabolism terminates with production of acetylCoA and propionylCoA; thus isoleucine is both glucogenic and ketogenic. Leucine gives rise to acetylCoA and acetoacetylCoA, and is thus classified as strictly ketogenic. <br/>There are a number of genetic diseases associated with faulty catabolism of the BCAAs. The most common defect is in the branched-chain a-keto acid dehydrogenase. Since there is only one dehydrogenase enzyme for all three amino acids, all three a-keto acids accumulate and are excreted in the urine. The disease is known as Maple syrup urine disease because of the characteristic odor of the urine in afflicted individuals. Mental retardation in these cases is extensive. Unfortunately, since these are essential amino acids, they cannot be heavily restricted in the diet; ultimately, the life of afflicted individuals is short and development is abnormal The main neurological problems are due to poor formation of myelin in the CNS."

DB00169,Cholecalciferol,CHEMBL1042,"The first step involved in the activation of vitamin D3 is a 25-hydroxylation which is catalysed by the 25-hydroxylase in the liver and then by other enzymes. The mitochondrial sterol 27-hydroxylase catalyses the first reaction in the oxidation of the side chain of sterol intermediates. The active form of vitamin D3 (calcitriol) binds to intracellular receptors that then function as transcription factors to modulate gene expression. Like the receptors for other steroid hormones and thyroid hormones, the vitamin D receptor has hormone-binding and DNA-binding domains. The vitamin D receptor forms a complex with another intracellular receptor, the retinoid-X receptor, and that heterodimer is what binds to DNA. In most cases studied, the effect is to activate transcription, but situations are also known in which vitamin D suppresses transcription. Calcitriol increases the serum calcium concentrations by: increasing GI absorption of phosphorus and calcium, increasing osteoclastic resorption, and increasing distal renal tubular reabsorption of calcium. Calcitriol appears to promote intestinal absorption of calcium through binding to the vitamin D receptor in the mucosal cytoplasm of the intestine. Subsequently, calcium is absorbed through formation of a calcium-binding protein."
DB00170,Menadione,CHEMBL590,"Menadione (vitamin K3) is involved as a cofactor in the posttranslational gamma-carboxylation of glutamic acid residues of certain proteins in the body. These proteins include the vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors II (prothrombin), VII (proconvertin), IX (Christmas factor), X (Stuart factor), protein C, protein S, protein Zv and a growth-arrest-specific factor (Gas6). In contrast to the other vitamin K-dependent proteins in the blood coagulation cascade, protein C and protein S serve anticoagulant roles. The two vitamin K-dependent proteins found in bone are osteocalcin, also known as bone G1a (gamma-carboxyglutamate) protein or BGP, and the matrix G1a protein or MGP. Gamma-carboxylation is catalyzed by the vitamin K-dependent gamma-carboxylases. The reduced form of vitamin K, vitamin K hydroquinone, is the actual cofactor for the gamma-carboxylases. Proteins containing gamma-carboxyglutamate are called G1a proteins."
DB00171,ATP,CHEMBL14249,"ATP is able to store and transport chemical energy within cells. ATP also plays an important role in the synthesis of nucleic acids. ATP can be produced by various cellular processes, most typically in mitochondria by oxidative phosphorylation under the catalytic influence of ATP synthase. The total quantity of ATP in the human body is about 0.1 mole. The energy used by human cells requires the hydrolysis of 200 to 300 moles of ATP daily. This means that each ATP molecule is recycled 2000 to 3000 times during a single day. ATP cannot be stored, hence its consumption must closely follow its synthesis."
DB00172,L-Proline,CHEMBL54922,"Glycogenic, by L-Proline oxidase in the kidney, it is ring-opened and is oxidized to form L-Glutamic acid. L-Ornithine and L-Glutamic acid are converted to L-Proline via L-Glutamic acid-gamma-semialdehyde. It is contained abundantly in collagen, and is intimately involved in the function of arthrosis and chordae."
DB00173,Adenine,CHEMBL226345,"Adenine forms adenosine, a nucleoside, when attached to ribose, and deoxyadenosine when attached to deoxyribose, and it forms adenosine triphosphate (ATP), a nucleotide, when three phosphate groups are added to adenosine. Adenosine triphosphate is used in cellular metabolism as one of the basic methods of transferring chemical energy between reactions. In older literature, adenine was sometimes called Vitamin B4Not Available"
DB00174,L-Asparagine,CHEMBL58832,"Asparagine, a non-essential amino acid is important in the metabolism of toxic ammonia in the body through the action of asparagine synthase which attaches ammonia to aspartic acid in an amidation reaction. Asparagine is also used as a structural component in many proteins."
DB00175,Pravastatin,CHEMBL1144,"Pravastatin is structurally similar to the HMG, a substituent of the endogenous substrate of HMG-CoA reductase. Unlike its parent compound, mevastatin, and statins such as lovastatin and simvastatin, pravastatin does not need to be activated <i>in vivo</i>. Its hydrolyzed lactone ring mimics the tetrahedral intermediate produced by the reductase allowing the agent to bind with a much greater affinity than its natural substrate. The bicyclic portion of pravastatin binds to the coenzyme A portion of the active site. Pravastatin sodium produces its lipid-lowering effect in two ways. First, as a consequence of its reversible inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase activity, it effects modest reductions in intracellular pools of cholesterol. This results in an increase in the number of LDL-receptors on cell surfaces and enhanced receptor-mediated catabolism and clearance of circulating LDL. Second, pravastatin inhibits LDL production by inhibiting hepatic synthesis of VLDL, the LDL precursor."
DB00176,Fluvoxamine,CHEMBL814,"The exact mechanism of action of fluvoxamine has not been fully determined, but appears to be linked to its inhibition of CNS neuronal uptake of serotonin. Fluvoxamine blocks the reuptake of serotonin at the serotonin reuptake pump of the neuronal membrane, enhancing the actions of serotonin on 5HT<sub>1A</sub> autoreceptors. In-vitro studies suggest that fluvoxamine is more potent than clomipramine, fluoxetine, and desipramine as a serotonin-reuptake inhibitor. Studies have also demonstrated that fluvoxamine has virtually no affinity for α<sub>1</sub>- or α<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic, β-adrenergic, muscarinic, dopamine D<sub>2</sub>, histamine H<sub>1</sub>, GABA-benzodiazepine, opiate, 5-HT<sub>1</sub>, or 5-HT<sub>2</sub> receptors."
DB00177,Valsartan,CHEMBL1069,"Valsartan is an ARB that selectively inhibits the binding of angiotensin II to AT1, which is found in many tissues such as vascular smooth muscle and the adrenal glands. This effectively inhibits the AT1-mediated vasoconstrictive and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II and results in a decrease in vascular resistance and blood pressure. Valsartan is selective for AT1 and has virtually no affinity for AT2. Inhibition of aldosterone secretion may inhibit sodium and water reabsorption in the kidneys while decreasing potassium excretion. The primary metabolite of valsartan, valeryl 4-hydroxy valsartan, has no pharmacological activity. "
DB00178,Ramipril,CHEMBL1168,"There are two isoforms of ACE: the somatic isoform, which exists as a glycoprotein comprised of a single polypeptide chain of 1277; and the testicular isoform, which has a lower molecular mass and is thought to play a role in sperm maturation and binding of sperm to the oviduct epithelium. Somatic ACE has two functionally active domains, N and C, which arise from tandem gene duplication. Although the two domains have high sequence similarity, they play distinct physiological roles. The C-domain is predominantly involved in blood pressure regulation while the N-domain plays a role in hematopoietic stem cell differentiation and proliferation. ACE inhibitors bind to and inhibit the activity of both domains, but have much greater affinity for and inhibitory activity against the C-domain. Ramiprilat, the principle active metabolite of ramipril, competes with ATI for binding to ACE and inhibits and enzymatic proteolysis of ATI to ATII. Decreasing ATII levels in the body decreases blood pressure by inhibiting the pressor effects of ATII as described in the Pharmacology section above. Ramipril also causes an increase in plasma renin activity likely due to a loss of feedback inhibition mediated by ATII on the release of renin and/or stimulation of reflex mechanisms via baroreceptors. "
DB00179,Masoprocol,CHEMBL313972,"Although the exact mechanism of action is not known, studies have shown that masoprocol is a potent 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor and has antiproliferative activity against keratinocytes in tissue culture, but the relationship between this activity and its effectiveness in actinic keratoses is unknown. Masoprocol also inhibits prostaglandins but the significance of this action is not yet known."
DB00180,Flunisolide,CHEMBL1512,"Flunisolide is a glucocorticoid receptor agonist. The antiinflammatory actions of corticosteroids are thought to involve lipocortins, phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins which, through inhibition arachidonic acid, control the biosynthesis of prostaglandins and leukotrienes. The immune system is suppressed by corticosteroids due to a decrease in the function of the lymphatic system, a reduction in immunoglobulin and complement concentrations, the precipitation of lymphocytopenia, and interference with antigen-antibody binding. Flunisolide binds to plasma transcortin, and it becomes active when it is not bound to transcortin."
DB00181,Baclofen,CHEMBL701,"Baclofen is a direct agonist at GABAB receptors. The precise mechanism of action of Baclofen is not fully known. It is capable of inhibiting both monosynaptic and polysynaptic reflexes at the spinal level, possibly by hyperpolarization of afferent terminals, although actions at supraspinal sites may also occur and contribute to its clinical effect."
DB00182,Amphetamine,CHEMBL405,"Amphetamines stimulate the release of norepinephrine from central adrenergic receptors. At higher dosages, they cause release of dopamine from the mesocorticolimbic system and the nigrostriatal dopamine systems. Amphetamine may also act as a direct agonist on central 5-HT receptors and may inhibit monoamine oxidase (MAO). In the periphery, amphetamines are believed to cause the release of noradrenaline by acting on the adrenergic nerve terminals and alpha- and beta-receptors. Modulation of serotonergic pathways may contribute to the calming affect. The drug interacts with VMAT enzymes to enhance release of DA and 5-HT from vesicles. It may also directly cause the reversal of DAT and SERT."
DB00183,Pentagastrin,CHEMBL1328,"The exact mechanism by which pentagastrin stimulates gastric acid, pepsin, and intrinsic factor secretion is unknown; however, since pentagastrin is an analogue of natural gastrin, it is believed that it excites the oxyntic cells of the stomach to secrete to their maximum capacity. Pentagastrin stimulates pancreatic secretion, especially when administered in large intramuscular doses. Pentagastrin also increases gastrointestinal motility by a direct effect on the intestinal smooth muscle. However, it delays gastric emptying time probably by stimulation of terminal antral contractions, which enhance retropulsion."
DB00184,Nicotine,CHEMBL3,"Nicotine is a stimulant drug that acts as an agonist at nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. These are ionotropic receptors composed up of five homomeric or heteromeric subunits. In the brain, nicotine binds to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors on dopaminergic neurons in the cortico-limbic pathways. This causes the channel to open and allow conductance of multiple cations including sodium, calcium, and potassium. This leads to depolarization, which activates voltage-gated calcium channels and allows more calcium to enter the axon terminal. Calcium stimulates vesicle trafficking towards the plasma membrane and the release of dopamine into the synapse. Dopamine binding to its receptors is responsible the euphoric and addictive properties of nicotine.
Nicotine also binds to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors on the chromaffin cells in the adrenal medulla. Binding opens the ion channel allowing influx of sodium, causing depolarization of the cell, which activates voltage-gated calcium channels. Calcium triggers the release of epinephrine from intracellular vesicles into the bloodstream, which causes vasoconstriction, increased blood pressure, increased heart rate, and increased blood sugar."
DB00185,Cevimeline,,"Muscarinic agonists such as cevimeline bind and activate the muscarinic M1 and M3 receptors. The M1 receptors are common in secretory glands (exocrine glands such as salivary and sweat glands), and their activation results in an increase in secretion from the secretory glands. The M3 receptors are found on smooth muscles and in many glands which help to stimulate secretion in salivary glands, and their activation generally results in smooth muscle contraction and increased glandular secretions. Therefore, as saliva excretion is increased, the symptoms of dry mouth are relieved."
DB00186,Lorazepam,CHEMBL580,"Lorazepam binds to an allosteric site on GABA-A receptors, which are pentameric ionotropic receptors in the CNS. Binding potentiates the effects of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA, which upon binding opens the chloride channel in the receptor, allowing chloride influx and causing hyperpolerization of the neuron."
DB00187,Esmolol,CHEMBL768,"Similar to other beta-blockers, esmolol blocks the agonistic effect of the sympathetic neurotransmitters by competing for receptor binding sites. Because it predominantly blocks the beta-1 receptors in cardiac tissue, it is said to be cardioselective. In general, so-called cardioselective beta-blockers are relatively cardioselective; at lower doses they block beta-1 receptors only but begin to block beta-2 receptors as the dose increases. At therapeutic dosages, esmolol does not have intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA) or membrane-stabilizing (quinidine-like) activity. Antiarrhythmic activity is due to blockade of adrenergic stimulation of cardiac pacemaker potentials. In the Vaughan Williams classification of antiarrhythmics, beta-blockers are considered to be class II agents."
DB00188,Bortezomib,CHEMBL325041,"Bortezomib is a reversible inhibitor of the chymotrypsin-like activity of the 26S proteasome in mammalian cells. The 26S proteasome is a large protein complex that degrades ubiquitinated proteins. The active site of the proteasome has chymotrypsin-like, trypsin-like, and postglutamyl peptide hydrolysis activity. The 26S proteasome degrades various proteins critical to cancer cell survival, such as cyclins, tumor suppressors, BCL-2, and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors. Inhibition of these degradations sensitizes cells to apoptosis. Bortezomib is a potent inhibitor of 26S proteasome, which sensitizes activity in dividing multiple myeloma and leukemic cells, thus inducing apoptosis. In addition, bortezomib appears to increase the sensitivity of cancer cells to traditional anticancer agents (e.g., gemcitabine, cisplatin, paclitaxel, irinotecan, and radiation)."
DB00189,Ethchlorvynol,CHEMBL591,"Although the exact mechanism of action is unknown, ethchlorvynol appears to depress the central nervous system in a manner similar to that of barbiturates. Barbiturates bind at a distinct binding sites associated with a Cl<sup>-</sup> ionopore at the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor, increasing the duration of time for which the Cl<sup>-</sup> ionopore is open. The post-synaptic inhibitory effect of GABA in the thalamus is, therefore, prolonged."
DB00190,Carbidopa,CHEMBL1201236,"When mixed with levodopa, carbidopa inhibits the peripheral conversion of levodopa to dopamine and the decarboxylation of oxitriptan to serotonin by aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase. This results in increased amount of levodopa and oxitriptan available for transport to the CNS. Carbidopa also inhibits the metabolism of levodopa in the GI tract, thus, increasing the bioavailability of levodopa."
DB00191,Phentermine,CHEMBL1574,"Phentermine is an amphetamine that stimulates neurons to release or maintain high levels of a particular group of neurotransmitters known as catecholamines; these include dopamine and norepinephrine. High levels of these catecholamines tend to suppress hunger signals and appetite. The drug seems to inhibit reuptake of noradrenaline, dopamine, and seratonin through inhibition or reversal of the reuptake transporters. It may also inhibit MAO enzymes leaving more neurotransmitter available at the synapse.Phentermine (through catecholamine elevation) may also indirectly affect leptin levels in the brain. It is theorized that phentermine can raise levels of leptin which signal satiety. It is also theorized that increased levels of the catecholamines are partially responsible for halting another chemical messenger known as neuropeptide Y. This peptide initiates eating, decreases energy expenditure, and increases fat storage."
DB00192,Indecainide,CHEMBL1201242,"Indecainide acts on sodium channels on the neuronal cell membrane, limiting the spread of seizure activity and reducing seizure propagation. The antiarrhythmic actions are mediated through effects on sodium channels in Purkinje fibers."
DB00193,Tramadol,CHEMBL1066,"Tramadol and its O-desmethyl metabolite (M1) are selective, weak OP3-receptor agonists. Opiate receptors are coupled with G-protein receptors and function as both positive and negative regulators of synaptic transmission via G-proteins that activate effector proteins. As the effector system is adenylate cyclase and cAMP located at the inner surface of the plasma membrane, opioids decrease intracellular cAMP by inhibiting adenylate cyclase. Subsequently, the release of nociceptive neurotransmitters such as substance P, GABA, dopamine, acetylcholine and noradrenaline is inhibited. The analgesic properties of Tramadol can be attributed to norepinephrine and serotonin reuptake blockade in the CNS, which inhibits pain transmission in the spinal cord. The (+) enantiomer has higher affinity for the OP3 receptor and preferentially inhibits serotonin uptake and enhances serotonin release. The (-) enantiomer preferentially inhibits norepinephrine reuptake by stimulating alpha(2)-adrenergic receptors."
DB00194,Vidarabine,CHEMBL1090,"Vidarabine stops replication of herpes viral DNA in 2 ways: 1) competitive inhibition of viral DNA polymerase, and consequently 2) incorporation into and termination of the growing viral DNA chain.
This drug is a nucleoside analog and therefore has to be phosphorylated to be active. Vidarabine is sequentially phosphorylated by kinases to the triphosphate ara-ATP. This is the active form of vidarabine and is both an inhibitor and a substrate of viral DNA polymerase. When used as a substrate for viral DNA polymerase, ara-ATP competitively inhibits dATP leading to the formation of ‘faulty’ DNA. This is where ara-ATP is incorporated into the DNA strand replacing many of the adenosine bases. This results in the prevention of DNA synthesis, as phosphodiester bridges can longer to be built, destabilizing the strand"
DB00195,Betaxolol,CHEMBL423,"Betaxolol selectively blocks catecholamine stimulation of beta(1)-adrenergic receptors in the heart and vascular smooth muscle. This results in a reduction of heart rate, cardiac output, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and possibly reflex orthostatic hypotension. Betaxolol can also competitively block beta(2)-adrenergic responses in the bronchial and vascular smooth muscles, causing bronchospasm."
DB00196,Fluconazole,CHEMBL106,"Fluconazole interacts with 14-&alpha; demethylase, a cytochrome P-450 enzyme necessary to convert lanosterol to ergosterol. As ergosterol is an essential component of the fungal cell membrane, inhibition of its synthesis results in increased cellular permeability causing leakage of cellular contents. Fluconazole may also inhibit endogenous respiration, interact with membrane phospholipids, inhibit the transformation of yeasts to mycelial forms, inhibit purine uptake, and impair triglyceride and/or phospholipid biosynthesis."
DB00197,Troglitazone,CHEMBL408,"Troglitazone is a thiazolidinedione antidiabetic agent that lowers blood glucose by improving target cell response to insulin. It has a unique mechanism of action that is dependent on the presence of insulin for activity. Troglitazone decreases hepatic glucose output and increases insulin dependent glucose disposal in skeletal muscle. Its mechanism of action is thought to involve binding to nuclear receptors (PPAR) that regulate the transcription of a number of insulin responsive genes critical for the control of glucose and lipid metabolism. Troglitazone is a ligand to both PPARα and PPARγ, with a highter affinity for PPARγ. The drug also contains an α-tocopheroyl moiety, potentially giving it vitamin E-like activity. Troglitazone has  been shown to reduce inflammation, and is associated with a decrase in nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB) and a concomitant increase in its inhibitor (IκB). NF-κB is an important cellular transcription regulator for the immune response. Unlike sulfonylureas, troglitazone is not an insulin secretagogue."
DB00198,Oseltamivir,CHEMBL1229,"Oseltamivir is an ethyl ester prodrug requiring ester hydrolysis for conversion to the active form, oseltamivir carboxylate. The proposed mechanism of action of oseltamivir is inhibition of influenza virus neuraminidase with the possibility of alteration of virus particle aggregation and release."
DB00199,Erythromycin,CHEMBL532,"Erythromycin acts by penetrating the bacterial cell membrane and reversibly binding to the 50 S subunit of bacterial ribosomes or near the &ldquo;P&rdquo; or donor site so that binding of tRNA (transfer RNA) to the donor site is blocked. Translocation of peptides from the &ldquo;A&rdquo; or acceptor site to the &ldquo;P&rdquo; or donor site is prevented, and subsequent protein synthesis is inhibited. Erythromycin is effective only against actively dividing organisms. The exact mechanism by which erythmromycin reduces lesions of acne vulgaris is not fully known: however, the effect appears to be due in part to the antibacterial activity of the drug."
DB00200,Hydroxocobalamin,CHEMBL2103737,"Vitamin B12 exists in four major forms referred to collectively as cobalamins; deoxyadenosylcobalamin, methylcobalamin, hydroxocobalamin, and cyanocobalamin. Two of these, methylcobalamin and 5-deoxyadenosyl cobalamin, are primarily used by the body. Methionine synthase needs methylcobalamin as a cofactor. This enzyme is involved in the conversion of the amino acid homocysteine into methionine. Methionine in turn is required for DNA methylation. 5-Deoxyadenosyl cobalamin is a cofactor needed by the enzyme that converts L-methylmalonyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA. This conversion is an important step in the extraction of energy from proteins and fats. Furthermore, succinyl CoA is necessary for the production of hemoglobin, the substances that carries oxygen in red blood cells."
DB00201,Caffeine,CHEMBL113,"Caffeine stimulates medullary, vagal, vasomotor, and respiratory centers, promoting bradycardia, vasoconstriction, and increased respiratory rate. This action was previously believed to be due primarily to increased intracellular cyclic 3&prime;,5&prime;-adenosine monophosphate (cyclic AMP) following inhibition of phosphodiesterase, the enzyme that degrades cyclic AMP. It is now thought that xanthines such as caffeine act as antagonists at adenosine-receptors within the plasma membrane of virtually every cell. As adenosine acts as an autocoid, inhibiting the release of neurotransmitters from presynaptic sites but augmenting the actions of norepinephrine or angiotensin, antagonism of adenosine receptors promotes neurotransmitter release. This explains the stimulatory effects of caffeine. Blockade of the adenosine A1 receptor in the heart leads to the accelerated, pronounced ""pounding"" of the heart upon caffeine intake."
DB00202,Succinylcholine,CHEMBL703,"The mechanism of action of Succinylcholine involves what appears to be a ""persistent"" depolarization of the neuromuscular junction. This depolarization is caused by Succinylcholine mimicking the effect of acetylcholine but without being rapidly hydrolysed by acetylcholinesterase. This depolarization leads to desensitization."
DB00203,Sildenafil,CHEMBL192,"Sildenafil inhibits the cGMP-specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) which is responsible for degradation of cGMP in the corpus cavernosum located around the penis. Penile erection during sexual stimulation is caused by increased penile blood flow resulting from the relaxation of penile arteries and corpus cavernosal smooth muscle. This response is mediated by the release of nitric oxide (NO) from nerve terminals and endothelial cells, which stimulates the synthesis of cGMP in smooth muscle cells. Cyclic GMP causes smooth muscle relaxation and increased blood flow into the corpus cavernosum. The inhibition of phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) by sildenafil enhances erectile function by increasing the amount of cGMP."
DB00204,Dofetilide,CHEMBL473,"The mechanism of action of Dofetilide is a blockade of the cardiac ion channel carrying the rapid component of the delayed rectifier potassium current, IKr. This inhibition of potassium channels results in a prolongation of action potential duration and the effective refractory period of accessory pathways (both anterograde and retrograde conduction in the accessory pathway)."
DB00205,Pyrimethamine,CHEMBL36,"Pyrimethamine inhibits the dihydrofolate reductase of plasmodia and thereby blocks the biosynthesis of purines and pyrimidines, which are essential for DNA synthesis and cell multiplication. This leads to failure of nuclear division at the time of schizont formation in erythrocytes and liver."
DB00206,Reserpine,CHEMBL772,Reserpine's mechanism of action is through inhibition of the ATP/Mg<sup>2+</sup> pump responsible for the sequestering of neurotransmitters into storage vesicles located in the presynaptic neuron. The neurotransmitters that are not sequestered in the storage vesicle are readily metabolized by monoamine oxidase (MAO) causing a reduction in catecholamines.
DB00207,Azithromycin,CHEMBL529,"Azithromycin binds to the 50S subunit of the 70S bacterial ribosomes, and therefore inhibits RNA-dependent protein synthesis in bacterial cells."
DB00208,Ticlopidine,CHEMBL833,"The active metabolite of ticlopidine prevents binding of adenosine diphosphate (ADP) to its platelet receptor, impairing the ADP-mediated activation of the glycoprotein GPIIb/IIIa complex. It is proposed that the inhibition involves a defect in the mobilization from the storage sites of the platelet granules to the outer membrane. No direct interference occurs with the GPIIb/IIIa receptor. As the glycoprotein GPIIb/IIIa complex is the major receptor for fibrinogen, its impaired activation prevents fibrinogen binding to platelets and inhibits platelet aggregation. By blocking the amplification of platelet activation by released ADP, platelet aggregation induced by agonists other than ADP is also inhibited by the active metabolite of ticlopidine."
DB00209,Trospium,CHEMBL1888176,Trospium antagonizes the effect of acetylcholine on muscarinic receptors in cholinergically innervated organs. Its parasympatholytic action reduces the tonus of smooth muscle in the bladder.
DB00210,Adapalene,CHEMBL1265,"Mechanistically, adapalene binds to specific retinoic acid nuclear receptors (gamma and beta) and retinoid X receptors but does not bind to the cytosolic receptor protein. Although the exact mode of action of adapalene is unknown, it is suggested that topical adapalene may normalize the differentiation of follicular epithelial cells resulting in decreased microcomedone formation."
DB00211,Midodrine,CHEMBL1201212,"Midodrine forms an active metabolite, desglymidodrine, that is an alpha<sub>1</sub>-agonist, and exerts its actions via activation of the alpha-adrenergic receptors of the arteriolar and venous vasculature, producing an increase in vascular tone and elevation of blood pressure. Desglymidodrine does not stimulate cardiac beta-adrenergic receptors."

DB00213,Pantoprazole,CHEMBL1502,"Pantoprazole is a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) that suppresses the final step in gastric acid production by forming a covalent bond to two sites of the (H<sup>+</sup>,K<sup>+</sup> )- ATPase enzyme system at the secretory surface of the gastric parietal cell. This effect is dose- related and leads to inhibition of both basal and stimulated gastric acid secretion irrespective of the stimulus."
DB00214,Torasemide,CHEMBL1148,"Torasemide inhibits the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>/2Cl<sup>-</sup>-carrier system (via interference of the chloride binding site) in the lumen of the thick ascending portion of the loop of Henle, resulting in a decrease in reabsorption of sodium and chloride. This results in an increase in the rate of delivery of tubular fluid and electrolytes to the distal sites of hydrogen and potassium ion secretion, while plasma volume contraction increases aldosterone production. The increased delivery and high aldosterone levels promote sodium reabsorption at the distal tubules, and By increasing the delivery of sodium to the distal renal tubule, torasemide indirectly increases potassium excretion via the sodium-potassium exchange mechanism. Torasemide's effects in other segments of the nephron have not been demonstrated. Thus torasemide increases the urinary excretion of sodium, chloride, and water, but it does not significantly alter glomerular filtration rate, renal plasma flow, or acid-base balance. Torasemide's effects as a antihypertensive are due to its diuretic actions. By reducing extracellular and plasma fluid volume, blood pressure is reduced temporarily, and cardiac output also decreases."
DB00215,Citalopram,CHEMBL549,"The antidepressant, antiobsessive-compulsive, and antibulimic actions of citalopram are presumed to be linked to its inhibition of CNS neuronal uptake of serotonin. Citalopram blocks the reuptake of serotonin at the serotonin reuptake pump of the neuronal membrane, enhancing the actions of serotonin on 5HT<sub>1A</sub> autoreceptors. SSRIs bind with significantly less affinity to histamine, acetylcholine, and norepinephrine receptors than tricyclic antidepressant drugs."
DB00216,Eletriptan,CHEMBL1510,"Eletriptan binds with high affinity to 5-HT1B, 5-HT1D and 5-HT1F receptors, has modest affinity for 5-HT1A, 5-HT1E, 5-HT2B and 5-HT7 receptors, and little or no affinity for 5-HT2A, 5-HT2C, 5-HT3, 5-HT4, 5-HT5A and 5-HT6 receptors. Eletriptan has no significant affinity or pharmacological activity at adrenergic alpha1, alpha2, or beta; dopaminergic D1 or D2; muscarinic; or opioid receptors. Two theories have been proposed to explain the efficacy of 5-HT receptor agonists in migraine. One theory suggests that activation of 5-HT1 receptors located on intracranial blood vessels, including those on the arteriovenous anastomoses, leads to vasoconstriction, which is correlated with the relief of migraine headache. The other hypothesis suggests that activation of 5-HT1 receptors on sensory nerve endings in the trigeminal system results in the inhibition of pro-inflammatory neuropeptide release."

DB00219,Oxyphenonium,CHEMBL1201286,Action is achieved via a dual mechanism: (1) a specific anticholinergic effect (antimuscarinic) at the acetylcholine-receptor sites and (2) a direct effect upon smooth muscle (musculotropic).
DB00220,Nelfinavir,CHEMBL584,"Nelfinavir inhibits the HIV viral proteinase enzyme which prevents cleavage of the gag-pol polyprotein, resulting in noninfectious, immature viral particles."
DB00221,Isoetarine,CHEMBL1201213,"The pharmacologic effects of isoetharine are attributable to stimulation through beta-adrenergic receptors of intracellular adenyl cyclase, the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to cyclic AMP. Increased cyclic AMP levels are associated with relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle and inhibition of release of mediators of immediate hypersensitivity from cells, especially from mast cells."
DB00222,Glimepiride,CHEMBL1481,"The mechanism of action of glimepiride in lowering blood glucose appears to be dependent on stimulating the release of insulin from functioning pancreatic beta cells, and increasing sensitivity of peripheral tissues to insulin. Glimepiride likely binds to ATP-sensitive potassium channel receptors on the pancreatic cell surface, reducing potassium conductance and causing depolarization of the membrane. Membrane depolarization stimulates calcium ion influx through voltage-sensitive calcium channels. This increase in intracellular calcium ion concentration induces the secretion of insulin."
DB00223,Diflorasone,CHEMBL1201380,"The precise mechanism of the antiinflammatory activity of topical steroids in the treatment of steroid-responsive dermatoses, in general, is uncertain. However, corticosteroids are thought to act by the induction of phospholipase A<sub>2</sub> inhibitory proteins, collectively called lipocortins. It is postulated that these proteins control the biosynthesis of potent mediators of inflammation such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes by inhibiting the release of their common precursor arachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid is released from membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A<sub>2</sub>."
DB00224,Indinavir,CHEMBL115,"Indinavir inhibits the HIV viral protease enzyme which prevents cleavage of the gag-pol polyprotein, resulting in noninfectious, immature viral particles."
DB00225,Gadodiamide,,"Based on the behavior of protons when placed in a strong magnetic field, which is interpreted and transformed into images by magnetic resonance (MR) instruments. Paramagnetic agents have unpaired electrons that generate a magnetic field about 700 times larger than the proton's field, thus disturbing the proton's local magnetic field. When the local magnetic field around a proton is disturbed, its relaxation process is altered. MR images are based on proton density and proton relaxation dynamics. MR instruments can record 2 different relaxation processes, the T1 (spin-lattice or longitudinal relaxation time) and the T2 (spin-spin or transverse relaxation time). In magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), visualization of normal and pathological brain tissue depends in part on variations in the radiofrequency signal intensity that occur with changes in proton density, alteration of the T1, and variation in the T2. When placed in a magnetic field, gadodiamide shortens both the T1 and the T2 relaxation times in tissues where it accumulates. At clinical doses, gadodiamide primarily affects the T1 relaxation time, thus producing an increase in signal intensity. Gadodiamide does not cross the intact blood-brain barrier; therefore, it does not accumulate in normal brain tissue or in central nervous system (CNS) lesions that have not caused an abnormal blood-brain barrier (e.g., cysts, mature post-operative scars). Abnormal vascularity or disruption of the blood-brain barrier allows accumulation of gadodiamide in lesions such as neoplasms, abscesses, and subacute infarcts."
DB00226,Guanadrel,CHEMBL1037,"Guanadrel is a postganglionic adrenergic blocking agent. Uptake of guanadrel and storage in sympathetic neurons occurs via the norepinephrine pump or transporter. Guanadrel slowly displaces norepinephrine from its storage in nerve endings and thereby blocks the release of norepinephrine normally produced by nerve stimulation. The reduction in neurotransmitter release in response to sympathetic nerve stimulation, as a result of catecholamine depletion, leads to reduced arteriolar vasoconstriction, especially the reflex increase in sympathetic tone that occurs with a change in position."
DB00227,Lovastatin,CHEMBL503,"Lovastatin is structurally similar to the HMG, a substituent of the endogenous substrate of HMG-CoA reductase. Lovastatin is a prodrug that is activated <i>in vivo</i> via hydrolysis of the lactone ring to form the β-hydroxyacid. The hydrolyzed lactone ring mimics the tetrahedral intermediate produced by the reductase allowing the agent to bind to HMG-CoA reductase with 20,000 times greater affinity than its natural substrate. The bicyclic portion of lovastatin binds to the coenzyme A portion of the active site. "
DB00228,Enflurane,CHEMBL1257,"Enflurane induces a reduction in junctional conductance by decreasing gap junction channel opening times and increasing gap junction channel closing times. Enflurane also activates calcium dependent ATPase in the sarcoplasmic reticulum by increasing the fluidity of the lipid membrane. It also appears to bind the D subunit of ATP synthase and NADH dehydogenase. Enflurane also binds to and angonizes the GABA receptor, the large conductance Ca<sup>2+</sup> activated potassium channel, the glycine receptor, and antagonizes the glutamate receptor receptor. These yield a decreased depolarization and therefore, tissue excitability which results in anesthesia."
DB00229,Cefotiam,CHEMBL1296,The bactericidal activity of cefotiam results from the inhibition of cell wall synthesis via affinity for penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs).
DB00230,Pregabalin,CHEMBL1059,"Pregabalin binds presynaptically to the alpha2-delta subunit of the voltage-gated calcium channels in central nervous system tissues located in the brain and spinal cord.[A31163] The mechanism of action has not been fully elucidated but studies suggest that pregabalin produces a disruption of calcium channel traficking or a reduction of calcium currents. The inhibition of subunits of voltage-gated calcium channels reduces calcium release which in order inhibits the release of several neurotransmitters [FDA label] Studies also suggest that the descending noradrenergic and serotonergic pathways originating from the brainstem may be involved with the mechanism of pregabalin. Interestingly, although pregabalin is a structural derivative of inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), it does not bind directly to GABA or benzodiazepine receptors.[A31165]"
DB00231,Temazepam,CHEMBL967,"Benzodiazepines bind nonspecifically to benzodiazepine receptors, which affects muscle relaxation, anticonvulsant activity, motor coordination, and memory. As benzodiazepine receptors are thought to be coupled to gamma-aminobutyric acid-A (GABA<sub>A</sub>) receptors, this enhances the effects of GABA by increasing GABA affinity for the GABA receptor. Binding of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA to the site opens the chloride channel, resulting in a hyperpolarized cell membrane that prevents further excitation of the cell."
DB00232,Methyclothiazide,CHEMBL1577,"Methyclothiazide appears to block the active reabsorption of chloride and possibly sodium in the ascending loop of Henle, altering electrolyte transfer in the proximal tubule. This results in excretion of sodium, chloride, and water and, hence, diuresis. As a diuretic, methyclothiazide inhibits active chloride reabsorption at the early distal tubule via the Na-Cl cotransporter, resulting in an increase in the excretion of sodium, chloride, and water. Thiazides like methyclothiazide also inhibit sodium ion transport across the renal tubular epithelium through binding to the thiazide sensitive sodium-chloride transporter. This results in an increase in potassium excretion via the sodium-potassium exchange mechanism. The antihypertensive mechanism of methyclothiazide is less well understood although it may be mediated through its action on carbonic anhydrases in the smooth muscle or through its action on the large-conductance calcium-activated potassium (KCa) channel, also found in the smooth muscle."
DB00233,Aminosalicylic Acid,CHEMBL1169,"There are two mechanisms responsible for aminosalicylic acid's bacteriostatic action against <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i>. Firstly, aminosalicylic acid inhibits folic acid synthesis (without potentiation with antifolic compounds). The binding of para-aminobenzoic acid to pteridine synthetase acts as the first step in folic acid synthesis. Aminosalicylic acid binds pteridine synthetase with greater affinity than para-aminobenzoic acid, effectively inhibiting the synthesis of folic acid. As bacteria are unable to use external sources of folic acid, cell growth and multiplication slows. Secondly, aminosalicylic acid may inhibit the synthesis of the cell wall component, mycobactin, thus reducing iron uptake by <i>M. tuberculosis</i>."
DB00234,Reboxetine,CHEMBL383921,"Reboxetine is a selective inhibitor of noradrenaline reuptake. It inhibits noradrenaline reuptake <i>in vitro</i> to a similar extent to the tricyclic antidepressant desmethylimipramine. Reboxetine does not affect dopamine or serotonin reuptake and it has low <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i> affinity for adrenergic, cholinergic, histaminergic, dopaminergic and serotonergic receptors."
DB00235,Milrinone,CHEMBL189,"Milrinone inhibits erythrocyte phosphodiesterase, resulting in an increase in erythrocyte cAMP activity. Subsequently, the erythrocyte membrane becomes more resistant to deformity. Along with erythrocyte activity, Milrinone also decreases blood viscosity by reducing plasma fibrinogen concentrations and increasing fibrinolytic activity."
DB00236,Pipobroman,CHEMBL1585,The mechanism of action is uncertain but pipobroman is thought to alkylate DNA leading to disruption of DNA synthesis and eventual cell death.
DB00237,Butabarbital,CHEMBL449,"Butabarbital binds at a distinct binding site associated with a Cl<sup>-</sup> ionopore at the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor, increasing the duration of time for which the Cl<sup>-</sup> ionopore is open. The post-synaptic inhibitory effect of GABA in the thalamus is, therefore, prolonged. All of these effects are associated with marked decreases in GABA-sensitive neuronal calcium conductance (gCa). The net result of barbiturate action is acute potentiation of inhibitory GABAergic tone. Barbiturates also act through potent (if less well characterized) and direct inhibition of excitatory AMPA-type glutamate receptors, resulting in a profound suppression of glutamatergic neurotransmission."
DB00238,Nevirapine,CHEMBL57,Nevirapine binds directly to reverse transcriptase (RT) and blocks the RNA-dependent and DNA-dependent DNA polymerase activities by causing a disruption of the enzyme's catalytic site. The activity of nevirapine does not compete with template or nucleoside triphosphates.
DB00239,Oxiconazole,CHEMBL1262,"Oxiconazole inhibits ergosterol biosynthesis, which is required for cytoplasmic membrane integrity of fungi. It acts to destabilize the fungal cyctochrome P450 51 enzyme (also known as Lanosterol 14-alpha demethylase). This is vital in the cell membrance structure of the fungus. Its inhibition leads to cell lysis. Oxiconazole has also been shown in inhibit DNA synthesis and suppress intracellular concentrations of ATP. Like other imidazole antifungals, Oxiconazole can increase membrane permeability to zinc, augmenting its cytotoxicity."
DB00240,Alclometasone,CHEMBL1201361,"The mechanism of the anti-inflammatory activity of the topical steroids, in general, is unclear. However, corticosteroids are thought to act by the induction of phospholipase A<sub>2</sub> inhibitory proteins, collectively called lipocortins. It is postulated that these proteins control the biosynthesis of potent mediators of inflammation such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes by inhibiting the release of their common precursor, arachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid is released from membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A<sub>2</sub>. Alclometasone initially binds the corticosteroid receptor. This complex migrates to the nucleus where it binds to different glucocorticoid response elements on the DNA. This in turn enhances and represses various genes, especially those involved in inflammatory pathways."
DB00241,Butalbital,CHEMBL454,"Butalbital binds at a distinct binding site associated with a Cl<sup>-</sup> ionopore at the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor, increasing the duration of time for which the Cl<sup>-</sup> ionopore is open. The post-synaptic inhibitory effect of GABA in the thalamus is, therefore, prolonged."
DB00242,Cladribine,CHEMBL1619,"Cladribine is structurally related to fludarabine and pentostatin but has a different mechanism of action. Although the exact mechanism of action has not been fully determined, evidence shows that cladribine is phosphorylated by deoxycytidine kinase to the nucleotidecladribine triphosphate (CdATP; 2-chloro-2′-deoxyadenosine 5′-triphosphate), which accumulates and is incorporated into DNA in cells such as lymphocytes that contain high levels of deoxycytidine kinase and low levels of deoxynucleotidase, resulting in DNA strand breakage and inhibition of DNA synthesis and repair. High levels of CdATP also appear to inhibit ribonucleotide reductase, which leads to an imbalance in triphosphorylated deoxynucleotide (dNTP) pools and subsequent DNA strand breaks, inhibition of DNA synthesis and repair, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and ATP depletion, and cell death. Unlike other antimetabolite drugs, cladribine has cytotoxic effects on resting as well as proliferating lymphocytes. However, it does cause cells to accumulate at the G1/S phase junction, suggesting that cytotoxicity is associated with events critical to cell entry into S phase. It also binds purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP), however no relationship between this binding and a mechanism of action has been established."
DB00243,Ranolazine,CHEMBL1404,"The mechanism of action of ranolazine is unknown. It does not increase the rate-pressure product, a measure of myocardial work, at maximal exercise. In vitro studies suggest that ranolazine is a P-gp inhibitor. Ranolazine is believed to have its effects via altering the trans-cellular late sodium current. It is by altering the intracellular sodium level that ranolazine affects the sodium-dependent calcium channels during myocardial ischemia. Thus, ranolazine indirectly prevents the calcium overload that causes cardiac ischemia."
DB00244,Mesalazine,CHEMBL704,"Although the mechanism of action of mesalazine is not fully understood, it appears to be topical rather than systemic. Mucosal production of arachidonic acid metabolites, both through the cyclooxygenase pathways, i.e., prostanoids, and through the lipoxygenase pathways, i.e., leukotrienes and hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids, is increased in patients with chronic inflammatory bowel disease, and it is possible that mesalazine diminishes inflammation by blocking cyclooxygenase and inhibiting prostaglandin production in the colon."
DB00245,Benzatropine,CHEMBL1201203,"Benztropine is a selective M1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist. It is able to discriminate between the M1 (cortical or neuronal) and the peripheral muscarinic subtypes (cardiac and glandular). Benztropine partially blocks cholinergic activity in the CNS, which is responsible for the symptoms of Parkinson's disease. It is also thought to increase the availability of dopamine, a brain chemical that is critical in the initiation and smooth control of voluntary muscle movement."
DB00246,Ziprasidone,CHEMBL708,Ziprasidone's antipsychotic activity is likely due to a combination of its antagonistic function at D2 receptors in the mesolimbic pathways and at 5HT2A receptors in the frontal cortex. Alleviation of positive symptoms is due to antagonism at D2 receptors while relief of negative symptoms are due to 5HT2A antagonism.
DB00247,Methysergide,CHEMBL1065,"Methysergide is serotonin antagonists acts on central nervous system (CNS), which directly stimulates the smooth muscle leading to vasoconstriction. Some alpha-adrenergic blocking activity has been reported. Suggestions have been made by investigators as to the mechanism whereby Methysergide produces its clinical effects, but this has not been finally established, although it may be related to the antiserotonin effect."
DB00248,Cabergoline,CHEMBL1201087,"The dopamine D<sub>2</sub> receptor is a 7-transmembrane G-protein coupled receptor associated with G<sub>i</sub> proteins. In lactotrophs, stimulation of dopamine D<sub>2</sub> causes inhibition of adenylyl cyclase, which decreases intracellular cAMP concentrations and blocks IP3-dependent release of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from intracellular stores. Decreases in intracellular calcium levels may also be brought about via inhibition of calcium influx through voltage-gated calcium channels, rather than via inhibition of adenylyl cyclase. Additionally, receptor activation blocks phosphorylation of p42/p44 MAPK and decreases MAPK/ERK kinase phosphorylation. Inhibition of MAPK appears to be mediated by c-Raf and B-Raf-dependent inhibition of MAPK/ERK kinase. Dopamine-stimulated growth hormone release from the pituitary gland is mediated by a decrease in intracellular calcium influx through voltage-gated calcium channels rather than via adenylyl cyclase inhibition. Stimulation of dopamine D<sub>2</sub> receptors in the nigrostriatal pathway leads to improvements in coordinated muscle activity in those with movement disorders. Cabergoline is a long-acting dopamine receptor agonist with a high affinity for D2 receptors. Receptor-binding studies indicate that cabergoline has low affinity for dopamine D1, &alpha;<sub>1</sub>,- and &alpha;<sub>2</sub>- adrenergic, and 5-HT<sub>1</sub>- and 5-HT<sub>2</sub>-serotonin receptors."
DB00249,Idoxuridine,CHEMBL788,Idoxuridine acts as an antiviral agent by inhibiting viral replication by substituting itself for thymidine in viral DNA. This in turn inhibits thymidylate phosphorylase and viral DNA polymerases from properly functioning. The effect of Idoxuridine results in the inability of the virus to reproduce or to infect/destroy tissue.
DB00250,Dapsone,CHEMBL1043,"Dapsone acts against bacteria and protozoa in the same way as sulphonamides, that is by inhibiting the synthesis of dihydrofolic acid through competition with para-amino-benzoate for the active site of dihydropteroate synthetase. The anti-inflammatory action of the drug is unrelated to its antibacterial action and is still not fully understood."
DB00251,Terconazole,CHEMBL1306,"Terconazole may exert its antifungal activity by disrupting normal fungal cell membrane permeability. Terconazole and other triazole antifungal agents inhibit cytochrome P450 14-alpha-demethylase in susceptible fungi, which leads to the accumulation of lanosterol and other methylated sterols and a decrease in ergosterol concentration. Depletion of ergosterol in the membrane disrupts the structure and function of the fungal cell leading to a decrease or inhibition of fungal growth."
DB00252,Phenytoin,CHEMBL16,"Phenytoin acts on sodium channels on the neuronal cell membrane, limiting the spread of seizure activity and reducing seizure propagation. By promoting sodium efflux from neurons, phenytoin tends to stabilize the threshold against hyperexcitability caused by excessive stimulation or environmental changes capable of reducing membrane sodium gradient. This includes the reduction of post-tetanic potentiation at synapses. Loss of post-tetanic potentiation prevents cortical seizure foci from detonating adjacent cortical areas."
DB00253,Medrysone,CHEMBL1201173,"There is no generally accepted explanation for the mechanism of action of ocular corticosteroids. However, corticosteroids are thought to act by the induction of phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins, collectively called lipocortins. It is postulated that these proteins control the biosynthesis of potent mediators of inflammation such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes by inhibiting the release of their common precursor, arachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid is released from membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A2. Initially, the drug binds to the glucocorticoid receptor in the cytosol. This migrates to the nucleus and binds to genetic elements which cause activation and repression of the involved genes in the inflammatory pathway."
DB00254,Doxycycline,CHEMBL1433,"Doxycycline, like minocycline, is lipophilic and can pass through the lipid bilayer of bacteria. Doxycycline reversibly binds to the 30 S ribosomal subunits and possibly the 50S ribosomal subunit(s), blocking the binding of aminoacyl tRNA to the mRNA and inhibiting bacterial protein synthesis. Doxycycline prevents the normal function of the apicoplast of Plasmodium falciparum, a malaria causing organism. "
DB00255,Diethylstilbestrol,CHEMBL411,"Estrogens diffuse into their target cells and interact with a protein receptor, the estrogen receptor. Target cells include the female reproductive tract, the mammary gland, the hypothalamus, and the pituitary. The effect of Estrogen binding their receptors causes downstream increases the hepatic synthesis of sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), thyroid-binding globulin (TBG), and other serum proteins and suppress follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) from the anterior pituitary. The combination of an estrogen with a progestin suppresses the hypothalamic-pituitary system, decreasing the secretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH)."
DB00256,Lymecycline,CHEMBL2103929,"Lymecycline inhibits cell growth by inhibiting translation. It binds to the 30S ribosomal subunit and prevents the amino-acyl tRNA from binding to the A site of the ribosome. The binding is reversible in nature. Lymecycline is lipophilic and can easily pass through the cell membrane or passively diffuses through porin channels in the bacterial membrane. Cells become resistant to lymecycline by at least two mechanisms: efflux and ribosomal protection. In efflux, a resistance gene encodes a membrane protein that actively pumps lymecycline out of the cell. This is the mechanism of action of the tetracycline resistance gene on the artificial plasmid pBR322. In ribosomal protection, a resistance gene encodes a protein which binds to the ribosome and prevents lymecycline from acting on the ribosome."
DB00257,Clotrimazole,CHEMBL104,"Clotrimazole interacts with yeast 14-&alpha; demethylase, a cytochrome P-450 enzyme that converts lanosterol to ergosterol, an essential component of the membrane. In this way, clotrimazole inhibits ergosterol synthesis, resulting in increased cellular permeability. Clotrimazole may also inhibit endogenous respiration, interact with membrane phospholipids, inhibit the transformation of yeasts to mycelial forms and the uptake of purine, impair triglyceride and/or phospholipid biosynthesis, and inhibit the movement of calcium and potassium ions across the cell membrane by blocking the ion transport pathway known as the Gardos channel."
DB00258,Calcium Acetate,CHEMBL1200800,"Calcium acetate and other calcium salts are phosphate binders. They work by binding with the phosphate in the food you eat, so that it is eliminated from the body without being absorbed."
DB00259,Sulfanilamide,CHEMBL21,"Sulfanilamide is a competitive inhibitor of bacterial enzyme dihydropteroate synthetase. This enzyme normally uses para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) for synthesizing the necessary folic acid. The inhibited reaction is normally necessary in these organisms for the synthesis of folic acid. Without it, bacteria cannot replicate."
DB00260,Cycloserine,CHEMBL771,"Cycloserine is an analog of the amino acid D-alanine. It interferes with an early step in bacterial cell wall synthesis in the cytoplasm by competitive inhibition of two enzymes, L-alanine racemase, which forms D-alanine from L-alanine, and D-alanylalanine synthetase, which incorporates D-alanine into the pentapeptide necessary for peptidoglycan formation and bacterial cell wall synthesis."
DB00261,Anagrelide,CHEMBL760,"The mechanism by which anagrelide reduces blood platelet count is still under investigation. Studies in patients support a hypothesis of dose-related reduction in platelet production resulting from a decrease in megakaryocyte hypermaturation. In blood withdrawn from normal volunteers treated with anagrelide, a disruption was found in the postmitotic phase of megakaryocyte development and a reduction in megakaryocyte size and ploidy. At therapeutic doses, anagrelide does not produce significant changes in white cell counts or coagulation parameters, and may have a small, but clinically insignificant effect on red cell parameters. Anagrelide inhibits cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase III (PDEIII). PDEIII inhibitors can also inhibit platelet aggregation. However, significant inhibition of platelet aggregation is observed only at doses of anagrelide higher than those required to reduce platelet count."
DB00262,Carmustine,CHEMBL513,"Carmustine causes cross-links in DNA and RNA, leading to the inhibition of DNA synthesis, RNA production and RNA translation (protein synthesis). Carmustine also binds to and modifies (carbamoylates) glutathione reductase. This leads to cell death."
DB00263,Sulfisoxazole,CHEMBL453,"Sulfisoxazole is a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme dihydropteroate synthetase. It inhibits bacterial synthesis of dihydrofolic acid by preventing the condensation of the pteridine with para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA), a substrate of the enzyme dihydropteroate synthetase. The inhibited reaction is necessary in these organisms for the synthesis of folic acid."
DB00264,Metoprolol,CHEMBL13,"Metoprolol competes with adrenergic neurotransmitters such as catecholamines for binding at beta(1)-adrenergic receptors in the heart. Beta(1)-receptor blockade results in a decrease in heart rate, cardiac output, and blood pressure."
DB00265,Crotamiton,CHEMBL1200709,"Crotamiton is an antiparasitic that is toxic to the scabies mite. Crotamiton also relieves itching by producing what is called a counter-irritation. As crotamiton evaporates from the skin, it produces a cooling effect. This cooling effect helps to divert your body's attention away from the itching."
DB00266,Dicoumarol,CHEMBL1466,"Dicumarol inhibits vitamin K reductase, resulting in depletion of the reduced form of vitamin K (vitamin KH2). As vitamin K is a cofactor for the carboxylation of glutamate residues on the N-terminal regions of vitamin K-dependent proteins, this limits the gamma-carboxylation and subsequent activation of the vitamin K-dependent coagulant proteins. The synthesis of vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors II, VII, IX, and X and anticoagulant proteins C and S is inhibited. Depression of three of the four vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors (factors II, VII, and X) results in decresed prothrombin levels and a decrease in the amount of thrombin generated and bound to fibrin. This reduces the thrombogenicity of clots."
DB00267,Cefmenoxime,CHEMBL1201224,"The bactericidal activity of cefmenoxime results from the inhibition of cell wall synthesis via affinity for penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs). Cefmenoxime is stable in the presence of a variety of b-lactamases, including penicillinases and some cephalosporinases."
DB00268,Ropinirole,CHEMBL589,"Ropinirole binds the dopamine receptors D<sub>3</sub> and D<sub>2</sub>. Although the precise mechanism of action of ropinirole as a treatment for Parkinson's disease is unknown, it is believed to be related to its ability to stimulate these receptors in the striatum. This conclusion is supported by electrophysiologic studies in animals that have demonstrated that ropinirole influences striatal neuronal firing rates via activation of dopamine receptors in the striatum and the substantia nigra, the site of neurons that send projections to the striatum."
DB00269,Chlorotrianisene,CHEMBL1200761,"Chlorotrianisene binds to the estrogen receptor on various estrogen receptor bearing cells. Target cells include cells in the female reproductive tract, the mammary gland, the hypothalamus, and the pituitary. Estrogens increase the hepatic synthesis of sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), thyroid-binding globulin (TBG), and other serum proteins and suppress follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) from the anterior pituitary."
DB00270,Isradipine,CHEMBL1648,"Isradipine belongs to the dihydropyridine (DHP) class of calcium channel blockers (CCBs), the most widely used class of CCBs. There are at least five different types of calcium channels in <i>Homo sapiens</i>: L-, N-, P/Q-, R- and T-type. CCBs target L-type calcium channels, the major channel in muscle cells that mediates contraction. Similar to other DHP CCBs, isradipine binds directly to inactive calcium channels stabilizing their inactive conformation. Since arterial smooth muscle depolarizations are longer in duration than cardiac muscle depolarizations, inactive channels are more prevalent in smooth muscle cells. Alternative splicing of the alpha-1 subunit of the channel gives isradipine additional arterial selectivity. At therapeutic sub-toxic concentrations, isradipine has little effect on cardiac myocytes and conduction cells."
DB00271,Diatrizoate,CHEMBL1201220,"Diatrizoate is an iodine-containing X-ray contrast agent.  Iodated contrast agents were among the first contrast agents developed.  Iodine is known to be particular electron-dense and to effectively scatter or stop X-rays. A good contrast agent requires a high density of electron-dense atoms. Therefore, the more iodine, the more ""dense"" the x-ray effect.  Iodine based contrast media are water soluble and harmless to the body. These contrast agents are sold as clear colorless water solutions, the concentration is usually expressed as mg I/ml. Modern iodinated contrast agents can be used almost anywhere in the body. Most often they are used intravenously, but for various purposes they can also be used intraarterially, intrathecally (the spine) and intraabdominally - just about any body cavity or potential space."
DB00272,Betazole,CHEMBL1201323,"Betazole is a histamine analogue. It produces the same effects as histamine, binding the H2 receptor which is a mediator of gastric acid secretion. This agonist action thereby results in an increase in the volume of gastric acid produced."
DB00273,Topiramate,CHEMBL220492,"The precise mechanism of action of topiramate is not known. However, studies have shown that topiramate blocks the action potentials elicited repetitively by a sustained depolarization of the neurons in a time-dependent manner, suggesting a state-dependent sodium channel blocking action. Topiramate also augments the activity of the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyrate (GABA) at some subtypes of the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor (controls an integral chloride channel), indicating a possible mechanism through potentiation of the activity of GABA. Topiramate also demonstrates antagonism of the AMPA/kainate subtype of the glutamate excitatory amino acid receptor. It also inhibits carbonic anhydrase (particularly isozymes II and IV), but this action is weak and unlikely to be related to its anticonvulsant actions."
DB00274,Cefmetazole,CHEMBL1201195,The bactericidal activity of cefmetazole results from the inhibition of cell wall synthesis via affinity for penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs).
DB00275,Olmesartan,CHEMBL1516,"Olmesartan is an ARB that selectively inhibits the binding of angiotensin II to AT1, which is found in many tissues such as vascular smooth muscle and the adrenal glands. This effectively inhibits the AT1-mediated vasoconstrictive and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II and results in a decrease in vascular resistance and blood pressure. Olmesartan is selective for AT1 and has a 12,500 times greater affinity for AT1 than the AT2 receptor. Also unlike the well-known ARB losartan, olmesartan does not have an active metabolite or possess uricosuric effects."
DB00276,Amsacrine,CHEMBL43,Amsacrine binds to DNA through intercalation and external binding. It has a base specificity for A-T pairs. Rapidly dividing cells are two to four times more sensitive to amsacrine than are resting cells. Amsacrine appears to cleave DNA by inducing double stranded breaks. Amsacrine also targets and inhibits topoisomerase II. Cytotoxicity is greatest during the S phase of the cell cycle when topoisomerase levels are at a maximum.
DB00277,Theophylline,CHEMBL190,"Theophylline relaxes the smooth muscle of the bronchial airways and pulmonary blood vessels and reduces airway responsiveness to histamine, methacholine, adenosine, and allergen. Theophylline competitively inhibits type III and type IV phosphodiesterase (PDE), the enzyme responsible for breaking down cyclic AMP in smooth muscle cells, possibly resulting in bronchodilation. Theophylline also binds to the adenosine A2B receptor and blocks adenosine mediated bronchoconstriction. In inflammatory states, theophylline activates histone deacetylase to prevent transcription of inflammatory genes that require the acetylation of histones for transcription to begin."
DB00278,Argatroban,CHEMBL59461,"Argatroban exerts its anticoagulant effects by inhibiting thrombin-catalyzed or -induced reactions, including fibrin formation; activation of coagulation factors V, VIII, and XIII; protein C; and platelet aggregation."
DB00279,Liothyronine,CHEMBL1544,"The hormones, T<sub>4</sub> and T<sub>3</sub>, are tyrosine-based hormones produced by the thyroid gland. Iodine is an important component in their synthesis. The major form of thyroid hormone in the blood is thyroxine (T4). This is converted to the more active liothyronine form by deiodinases in peripheral tissues. Liothyronine acts on the body to increase the basal metabolic rate, affect protein synthesis and increase the body's sensitivity to catecholamines (such as adrenaline). The thyroid hormones are essential to proper development and differentiation of all cells of the human body. To various extents T<sub>4</sub> and T<sub>3</sub> regulate protein, fat and carbohydrate metabolism. Their most pronounced effect is on how human cells use energetic compounds. The thyroid hormone derivatives bind to the thyroid hormone receptors initially to initiate their downstream effects."
DB00280,Disopyramide,CHEMBL517,"Disopyramide is a Type 1A antiarrhythmic drug (ie, similar to procainamide and quinidine). It inhibits the fast sodium channels. In animal studies Disopyramide decreases the rate of diastolic depolarization (phase 4) in cells with augmented automaticity, decreases the upstroke velocity (phase 0) and increases the action potential duration of normal cardiac cells, decreases the disparity in refractoriness between infarcted and adjacent normally perfused myocardium, and has no effect on alpha- or beta-adrenergic receptors."
DB00281,Lidocaine,CHEMBL79,Lidocaine stabilizes the neuronal membrane by inhibiting the ionic fluxes required for the initiation and conduction of impulses thereby effecting local anesthetic action. Lidocaine alters signal conduction in neurons by blocking the fast voltage gated sodium (Na+) channels in the neuronal cell membrane that are responsible for signal propagation. With sufficient blockage the membrane of the postsynaptic neuron will not depolarize and will thus fail to transmit an action potential. This creates the anaesthetic effect by not merely preventing pain signals from propagating to the brain but by aborting their birth in the first place.
DB00282,Pamidronate,CHEMBL834,"The mechanism of action of pamidronate is inhibition of bone resorption. Pamidronate adsorbs to calcium phosphate (hydroxyapatite) crystals in bone and may directly block dissolution of this mineral component of bone. In vitro studies also suggest that inhibition of osteoclast activity contributes to inhibition of bone resorption. Pamidronate also targets farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) synthase. Nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates (such as pamidronate, alendronate, risedronate, ibandronate and zoledronate) appear to act as analogues of isoprenoid diphosphate lipids, thereby inhibiting FPP synthase, an enzyme in the mevalonate pathway. Inhibition of this enzyme in osteoclasts prevents the biosynthesis of isoprenoid lipids (FPP and GGPP) that are essential for the post-translational farnesylation and geranylgeranylation of small GTPase signalling proteins. This activity inhibits osteoclast activity and reduces bone resorption and turnover. In postmenopausal women, it reduces the elevated rate of bone turnover, leading to, on average, a net gain in bone mass."
DB00283,Clemastine,CHEMBL1626,"Clemastine is a selective histamine H1 antagonist and binds to the histamine H1 receptor. This blocks the action of endogenous histamine, which subsequently leads to temporary relief of the negative symptoms brought on by histamine."
DB00284,Acarbose,CHEMBL1566,"Acarbose reversibly bind to pancreatic alpha-amylase and membrane-bound intestinal alpha-glucoside hydrolases. These enzymes inhibit hydrolysis of complex starches to oligosaccharides in the lumen of the small intestine and hydrolysis of oligosaccharides, trisaccharides, and disaccharides to glucose and other monosaccharides in the brush border of the small intestine."
DB00285,Venlafaxine,CHEMBL637,"The exact mechanism of action of venlafaxine is unknown, but appears to be associated with the its potentiation of neurotransmitter activity in the CNS. Venlafaxine and its active metabolite, O-desmethylvenlafaxine (ODV), inhibit the reuptake of both serotonin and norepinephrine with a potency greater for the 5-HT than for the NE reuptake process. Both venlafaxine and the ODV metabolite have weak inhibitory effects on the reuptake of dopamine but, unlike the tricyclics and similar to SSRIs, they are not active at histaminergic, muscarinic, or alpha(1)-adrenergic receptors."
DB00286,Conjugated estrogens,CHEMBL2106240,"All estrogen products mimic the effects of endogenous estrogens in the body which are responsible for the development and maintenance of the female reproductive system and secondary sexual characteristics. Estrogens act by binding to estrogen receptors on a wide variety of tissues in the body and modulating the pituitary secretion of the gonadotropins, luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) through a negative feedback mechanism. Prior to menopause, the primary source of estrogen is the ovarian follicle, which secretes 70-500 micrograms of estradiol daily, depending on the phase of the menstrual cycle. However, once a woman stops ovulating there is a sharp decline in the production of progesterone and estradiol by the ovaries and a consequent fluctuation in LH and FSH due to a lack of feedback control. This shift in hormone production is largely responsible for many of the symptoms experienced during and after menopause and includes hot flashes and other vasomotor symptoms, painful intercourse, vaginal dryness, and vulvovaginal atrophy. These symptoms are able to be reduced by replacing many of the hormones lost during and following menopause with synthetic or naturally occurring forms, in a therapy known as Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT)."
DB00287,Travoprost,CHEMBL1200799,"Travoprost free acid is a selective FP prostanoid receptor agonist and is believed to reduce intraocular pressure by increasing the drainage of aqueous humor, which is done primarily through increased uveoscleral outflow and to a lesser extent, trabecular outflow facility."
DB00288,Amcinonide,CHEMBL1200732,"The mechanism of the anti-inflammatory activity of the topical steroids, in general, is unclear. However, corticosteroids are thought to act by the induction of phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins, collectively called lipocortins. It is postulated that these proteins control the biosynthesis of potent mediators of inflammation such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes by inhibiting the release of their common precursor, arachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid is released from membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A2. Amcinonide has affinity for the glucocorticoid receptor. It has weak affinity for the progesterone receptor, and virtually no affinity for the mineralocorticoid, estrogen, or androgen receptors."
DB00289,Atomoxetine,CHEMBL641,"The precise mechanism by which atomoxetine produces its therapeutic effects in Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is unknown, but is thought to be related to selective inhibition of the pre-synaptic norepinephrine transporter, as determined through in-vitro studies. Atomoxetine appears to have minimal affinity for other noradrenergic receptors or for other neurotransmitter transporters or receptors."
DB00290,Bleomycin,CHEMBL403664,"Although the exact mechanism of action of bleomycin is unknown, available evidence would seem to indicate that the main mode of action is the inhibition of DNA synthesis with some evidence of lesser inhibition of RNA and protein synthesis. DNA cleavage by bleomycin depends on oxygen and metal ions, at least in vitro. It is believed that bleomycin chelates  metal ions (primarily iron) producing a pseudoenzyme that reacts with oxygen to produce superoxide and hydroxide free radicals that cleave DNA."
DB00291,Chlorambucil,CHEMBL515,"Alkylating agents work by three different mechanisms: 1) attachment of alkyl groups to DNA bases, resulting in the DNA being fragmented by repair enzymes in their attempts to replace the alkylated bases, preventing DNA synthesis and RNA transcription from the affected DNA, 2) DNA damage via the formation of cross-links (bonds between atoms in the DNA) which prevents DNA from being separated for synthesis or transcription, and 3) the induction of mispairing of the nucleotides leading to mutations."
DB00292,Etomidate,CHEMBL681,"Etomidate binds at a distinct binding site associated with a Cl<sup>-</sup> ionopore at the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor, increasing the duration of time for which the Cl<sup>-</sup> ionopore is open. The post-synaptic inhibitory effect of GABA in the thalamus is, therefore, prolonged."
DB00293,Raltitrexed,CHEMBL225071,"Raltitrexed is an antineoplastic Agents and folic acid antagonists. Raltitrexed inhibits thymidylate synthase (TS) leading to DNA fragmentation and cell death. It is transported into cells via a reduced folate carrier. Inside the cell Raltitrexed is extensively polyglutamated, which enhances thymidylate synthase inhibitory power and duration. Inhibition of this enzyme results in decreased synthesis of thymidine triphosphate which is required for DNA synthesis. "
DB00294,Etonogestrel,CHEMBL1531,"Etonogestrel binds to the progesterone and estrogen receptors. Target cells include the female reproductive tract, the mammary gland, the hypothalamus, and the pituitary. Once bound to the receptor, progestins like etonogestrel will slow the frequency of release of gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) from the hypothalamus and blunt the pre-ovulatory LH (luteinizing hormone) surge."
DB00295,Morphine,CHEMBL70,"The precise mechanism of the analgesic action of morphine is unknown. However, specific CNS opiate receptors have been identified and likely play a role in the expression of analgesic effects. Morphine first acts on the mu-opioid receptors. The mechanism of respiratory depression involves a reduction in the responsiveness of the brain stem respiratory centers to increases in carbon dioxide tension and to electrical stimulation.
It has been shown that morphine binds to and inhibits GABA inhibitory interneurons. These interneurons normally inhibit the descending pain inhibition pathway. So, without the inhibitory signals, pain modulation can proceed downstream."
DB00296,Ropivacaine,CHEMBL1077896,"Local anesthetics such as Ropivacaine block the generation and the conduction of nerve impulses, presumably by increasing the threshold for electrical excitation in the nerve, by slowing the propagation of the nerve impulse, and by reducing the rate of rise of the action potential. Specifically, they block the sodium-channel and decrease chances of depolarization and consequent action potentials. In general, the progression of anesthesia is related to the diameter, myelination and conduction velocity of affected nerve fibers."
DB00297,Bupivacaine,CHEMBL1098,"Local anesthetics such as bupivacaine block the generation and the conduction of nerve impulses, presumably by increasing the threshold for electrical excitation in the nerve, by slowing the propagation of the nerve impulse, and by reducing the rate of rise of the action potential. Bupivacaine binds to the intracellular portion of sodium channels and blocks sodium influx into nerve cells, which prevents depolarization. In general, the progression of anesthesia is related to the diameter, myelination and conduction velocity of affected nerve fibers. Clinically, the order of loss of nerve function is as follows: (1) pain, (2) temperature, (3) touch, (4) proprioception, and (5) skeletal muscle tone. The analgesic effects of Bupivicaine are thought to potentially be due to its binding to the prostaglandin E2 receptors, subtype EP1 (PGE2EP1), which inhibits the production of prostaglandins, thereby reducing fever, inflammation, and hyperalgesia."
DB00298,Dapiprazole,CHEMBL1201216,"Dapiprazole acts through blocking the alpha1-adrenergic receptors in smooth muscle. It produces miosis through an effect on the dilator muscle of the iris and does not have any significant activity on ciliary muscle contraction and, therefore does not induce a significant change in the anterior chamber depth or the thickness of the lens."
DB00299,Penciclovir,CHEMBL1540,"Penciclovir has <i>in vitro</i> activity against herpes simplex virus types 1 (HSV-1) and 2 (HSV-2). In cells infected with HSV-1 or HSV-2, viral thymidine kinase phosphorylates penciclovir to a monophosphate form. The monophosphate form of the drug is then converted to penciclovir triphosphate by cellular kinases. The intracellular triphosphate of penciclovir is retained <i>in vitro</i> inside HSV-infected cells for 10-20 hours, compared with 0.7-1 hour for acyclovir. <i>in vitro</i> studies show that penciclovir triphosphate selectively inhibits viral DNA polymerase by competing with deoxyguanosine triphosphate. Inhibition of DNA synthesis of virus-infected cells inhibits viral replication. In cells not infected with HSV, DNA synthesis is unaltered. Resistant mutants of HSV can occur from qualitative changes in viral thymidine kinase or DNA polymerase. The most commonly encountered acyclovir-resistant mutants that are deficient in viral thymidine kinase are also resistant to penciclovir."
DB00300,Tenofovir disoproxil,CHEMBL1538,"Tenofovir inhibits the activity of HIV reverse transcriptase by competing with the natural substrate deoxyadenosine 5'-triphosphate and, after incorporation into DNA, by DNA chain termination. Specifically, the drugs are analogues of the naturally occurring deoxynucleotides needed to synthesize the viral DNA and they compete with the natural deoxynucleotides for incorporation into the growing viral DNA chain. However, unlike the natural deoxynucleotides substrates, NRTIs and NTRTIs (nucleoside/tide reverse transcriptase inhibitors) lack a 3'-hydroxyl group on the deoxyribose moiety. As a result, following incorporation of an NRTI or an NtRTI, the next incoming deoxynucleotide cannot form the next 5'-3' phosphodiester bond needed to extend the DNA chain. Thus, when an NRTI or NtRTI is incorporated, viral DNA synthesis is halted, a process known as chain termination. All NRTIs and NtRTIs are classified as competitive substrate inhibitors."
DB00301,Flucloxacillin,CHEMBL222645,"By binding to specific penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) located inside the bacterial cell wall, flucloxacillin inhibits the third and last stage of bacterial cell wall synthesis. Cell lysis is then mediated by bacterial cell wall autolytic enzymes such as autolysins; it is possible that flucloxacillin interferes with an autolysin inhibitor."
DB00302,Tranexamic Acid,CHEMBL877,"Tranexamic acid competitively inhibits activation of plasminogen (via binding to the kringle domain), thereby reducing conversion of plasminogen to plasmin (fibrinolysin), an enzyme that degrades fibrin clots, fibrinogen, and other plasma proteins, including the procoagulant factors V and VIII. Tranexamic acid also directly inhibits plasmin activity, but higher doses are required than are needed to reduce plasmin formation."
DB00303,Ertapenem,CHEMBL1359,"The bactericidal activity of ertapenem results from the inhibition of cell wall synthesis and is mediated through ertapenem binding to penicillin binding proteins (PBPs). In <i>Escherichia coli</i>, it has strong affinity toward PBPs 1a, 1b, 2, 3, 4 and 5 with preference for PBPs 2 and 3. Ertapenem is stable against hydrolysis by a variety of beta-lactamases, including penicillinases, and cephalosporinases and extended spectrum beta-lactamases. Ertapenem is hydrolyzed by metallo-beta-lactamases."
DB00304,Desogestrel,CHEMBL1533,"Binds to the progesterone and estrogen receptors. Target cells include the female reproductive tract, the mammary gland, the hypothalamus, and the pituitary. Once bound to the receptor, progestins like desogestrel will slow the frequency of release of gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) from the hypothalamus and blunt the pre-ovulatory LH (luteinizing hormone) surge."
DB00305,Mitomycin,CHEMBL105,Mitomycin is activated in vivo to a bifunctional and trifunctional alkylating agent. Binding to DNA leads to cross-linking and inhibition of DNA synthesis and function. Mitomycin is cell cycle phase-nonspecific.
DB00306,Talbutal,CHEMBL1200802,"Talbutal binds at a distinct binding site associated with a Cl<sup>-</sup> ionopore at the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor, increasing the duration of time for which the Cl<sup>-</sup> ionopore is open. The post-synaptic inhibitory effect of GABA in the thalamus is, therefore, prolonged."
DB00307,Bexarotene,CHEMBL1023,"Bexarotene selectively binds with and activates retinoid X receptor subtypes. There are three subtypes in total: RXR<sub>α</sub>, RXR<sub>β</sub>, RXR<sub>γ</sub>. The exact mechanism of action of bexarotene in the treatment of CTCL is unknown but the drug has activity in all clinical stages of CTCL."
DB00308,Ibutilide,CHEMBL533,"Ibutilide is a 'pure' class III antiarrhythmic drug, used intravenously against atrial flutter and fibrillation. At a cellular level it exerts two main actions: induction of a persistent Na+ current sensitive to dihydropyridine Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel blockers and potent inhibition of the cardiac rapid delayed rectifier K<sup>+</sup> current, by binding within potassium channel pores. In other words, Ibutilide binds to and alters the activity of hERG potassium channels, delayed inward rectifier potassium (IKr) channels and L-type (dihydropyridine sensitive) calcium channels"
DB00309,Vindesine,CHEMBL219146,Vindesine acts by causing the arrest of cells in metaphase mitosis through its inhibition tubulin mitotic funcitoning. The drug is cell-cycle specific for the S phase.
DB00310,Chlorthalidone,CHEMBL1055,"Chlorthalidone inhibits sodium ion transport across the renal tubular epithelium in the cortical diluting segment of the ascending limb of the loop of Henle. By increasing the delivery of sodium to the distal renal tubule, Chlorthalidone indirectly increases potassium excretion via the sodium-potassium exchange mechanism."
DB00311,Ethoxzolamide,CHEMBL18,"Ethoxzolamide binds and inhibits carbonic anhydrase I. Carbonic anhydrase plays an essential role in facilitating the transport of carbon dioxide and protons in the intracellular space, across biological membranes and in the layers of the extracellular space. The inhibition of this enzyme effects the balance of applicable membrane equilibrium systems. This reduction in carbonic anhydrase also reduces the intraocular pressure in the eye by decreasing aqueous humor."
DB00312,Pentobarbital,CHEMBL448,"Pentobarbital binds at a distinct binding site associated with a Cl- ionopore at the GABAA receptor, increasing the duration of time for which the Cl- ionopore is open. The post-synaptic inhibitory effect of GABA in the thalamus is, therefore, prolonged. All of these effects are associated with marked decreases in GABA-sensitive neuronal calcium conductance (gCa). The net result of barbiturate action is acute potentiation of inhibitory GABAergic tone. Barbiturates also act through potent (if less well characterized) and direct inhibition of excitatory AMPA-type glutamate receptors, resulting in a profound suppression of glutamatergic neurotransmission."
DB00313,Valproic Acid,CHEMBL109,"Valproic Acid dissociates to the valproate ion in the gastrointestinal tract and then binds to and inhibits GABA transaminase. The drug's anticonvulsant activity may be related to increased brain concentrations of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), an inhibitory neurotransmitter in the CNS, by inhibiting enzymes that catabolize GABA or block the reuptake of GABA into glia and nerve endings. Valproic Acid may also work by suppressing repetitive neuronal firing through inhibition of voltage-sensitive sodium channels. It is also a histone deacetylase inhibitor. Valproic acid has also been shown to be an inhibitor of an enzyme called histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1). HDAC1 is needed for HIV to remain in infected cells. A study published in August 2005 revealed that patients treated with valproic acid in addition to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) showed a 75% reduction in latent HIV infection."
DB00314,Capreomycin,CHEMBL2303634,"Little is known about capreomycin's exact mechanism of action, but it is thought to inhibit protein synthesis by binding to the 70S ribosomal unit. Capreomycin also binds to components in the bacterial cell which result in the production of abnormal proteins. These proteins are necessary for the bacteria's survival. Therefore the production of these abnormal proteins is ultimately fatal to the bacteria."
DB00315,Zolmitriptan,CHEMBL1185,"Zolmitriptan binds with high affinity to human 5-HT<sub>1B</sub> and 5-HT<sub>1D</sub> receptors leading to cranial blood vessel constriction. Current theories proposed to explain the etiology of migraine headache suggest that symptoms are due to local cranial vasodilatation and/or to the release of sensory neuropeptides (vasoactive intestinal peptide, substance P and calcitonin gene-related peptide) through nerve endings in the trigeminal system. The therapeutic activity of zolmitriptan for the treatment of migraine headache can most likely be attributed to the agonist effects at the 5HT1B/1D receptors on intracranial blood vessels (including the arterio-venous anastomoses) and sensory nerves of the trigeminal system which result in cranial vessel constriction and inhibition of pro-inflammatory neuropeptide release."
DB00316,Acetaminophen,CHEMBL112,"Acetaminophen is thought to act primarily in the CNS, increasing the pain threshold by inhibiting both isoforms of cyclooxygenase, COX-1, COX-2, and COX-3 enzymes involved in prostaglandin (PG) synthesis. Unlike NSAIDs, acetaminophen does not inhibit cyclooxygenase in peripheral tissues and, thus, has no peripheral anti-inflammatory affects. While aspirin acts as an irreversible inhibitor of COX and directly blocks the enzyme's active site, studies have found that acetaminophen indirectly blocks COX, and that this blockade is ineffective in the presence of peroxides. This might explain why acetaminophen is effective in the central nervous system and in endothelial cells but not in platelets and immune cells which have high levels of peroxides. Studies also report data suggesting that acetaminophen selectively blocks a variant of the COX enzyme that is different from the known variants COX-1 and COX-2. This enzyme is now referred to as COX-3. Its exact mechanism of action is still poorly understood, but future research may provide further insight into how it works. The antipyretic properties of acetaminophen are likely due to direct effects on the heat-regulating centres of the hypothalamus resulting in peripheral vasodilation, sweating and hence heat dissipation. "
DB00317,Gefitinib,CHEMBL939,"Gefitinib inhibits the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase by binding to the adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-binding site of the enzyme. Thus the function of the EGFR tyrosine kinase in activating the Ras signal transduction cascade is inhibited; and malignant cells are inhibited. Gefitinib is the first selective inhibitor of the EGFR tyrosine kinase which is also referred to as Her1 or ErbB-1. EGFR is overexpressed in the cells of certain types of human carcinomas - for example in lung and breast cancers. Overexpression leads to inappropriate activation of the apoptotic Ras signal transduction cascade, eventually leading to uncontrolled cell proliferation."
DB00318,Codeine,CHEMBL485,"Opiate receptors are coupled with G-protein receptors and function as both positive and negative regulators of synaptic transmission via G-proteins that activate effector proteins. Binding of the opiate stimulates the exchange of GTP for GDP on the G-protein complex. As the effector system is adenylate cyclase and cAMP located at the inner surface of the plasma membrane, opioids decrease intracellular cAMP by inhibiting adenylate cyclase. Subsequently, the release of nociceptive neurotransmitters such as substance P, GABA, dopamine, acetylcholine and noradrenaline is inhibited. Opioids also inhibit the release of vasopressin, somatostatin, insulin and glucagon. Codeine's analgesic activity is, most likely, due to its conversion to morphine. Opioids close N-type voltage-operated calcium channels (OP2-receptor agonist) and open calcium-dependent inwardly rectifying potassium channels (OP3 and OP1 receptor agonist). This results in hyperpolarization and reduced neuronal excitability."
DB00319,Piperacillin,CHEMBL702,"By binding to specific penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) located inside the bacterial cell wall, Piperacillin inhibits the third and last stage of bacterial cell wall synthesis. Cell lysis is then mediated by bacterial cell wall autolytic enzymes such as autolysins; it is possible that Piperacillin interferes with an autolysin inhibitor."
DB00320,Dihydroergotamine,CHEMBL1732,"Two theories have been proposed to explain the efficacy of 5-HT<sub>1D</sub> receptor agonists in migraine: 1) activation of 5-HT<sub>1D</sub> receptors located on intracranial blood vessels, including those on arterio-venous anastomoses, leads to vasoconstriction, which correlates with the relief of migraine headache and 2) activation of 5-HT<sub>1D</sub> receptors on sensory nerve endings of the trigeminal system results in the inhibition of pro-inflammatory neuropeptide release."
DB00321,Amitriptyline,CHEMBL629,Amitriptyline is metabolized to nortriptyline which inhibits the reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin almost equally. Amitriptyline inhibits the membrane pump mechanism responsible for uptake of norepinephrine and serotonin in adrenergic and serotonergic neurons. Pharmacologically this action may potentiate or prolong neuronal activity since reuptake of these biogenic amines is important physiologically in terminating transmitting activity. This interference with the reuptake of norepinephrine and/or serotonin is believed by some to underlie the antidepressant activity of amitriptyline.
DB00322,Floxuridine,CHEMBL917,"Floxuridine is rapidly catabolized to 5-fluorouracil, which is the active form of the drug. The primary effect is interference with DNA synthesis and to a lesser extent, inhibition of RNA formation through the drug's incorporation into RNA, thus leading to the production of fraudulent RNA. Fluorouracil also inhibits uracil riboside phophorylase, which prevents the utilization of preformed uracil in RNA synthesis. As well, the monophosphate of floxuridine, 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine-5'-phosphate (FUDR-MP) inhibits the enzyme thymidylate synthetase. This leads to the inhibition of methylation of deoxyuridylic acid to thymidylic acid, thus interfering with DNA synthesis."
DB00323,Tolcapone,CHEMBL1324,"The precise mechanism of action of tolcapone is unknown, but it is believed to be related to its ability to inhibit COMT and alter the plasma pharmacokinetics of levodopa, resulting in an increase in plasma levodopa concentrations. The inhibition of COMT also causes a reduction in circulating 3-OMD as a result of decreased peripheral metabolism of levodopa. This may lead to an increase distribution of levodopa into the CNS through the reduction of its competitive substrate, 3-OMD, for transport mechanisms. Sustained levodopa concentrations presumably result in more consistent dopaminergic stimulation, resulting in greater reduction in the manifestations of parkinsonian syndrome."
DB00324,Fluorometholone,CHEMBL1200600,"There is no generally accepted explanation for the mechanism of action of ocular corticosteroids. However, corticosteroids are thought to act by the induction of phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins, collectively called lipocortins. It is postulated that these proteins control the biosynthesis of potent mediators of inflammation such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes by inhibiting the release of their common precursor, arachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid is released from membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A2. Their primary target is the cytosolic glucocorticoid receptor. After binding the receptor the newly formed receptor-ligand complex translocates itself into the cell nucleus, where it binds to many glucocorticoid response elements (GRE) in the promoter region of the target genes. The DNA bound receptor then interacts with basic transcription factors, causing the increase in expression of specific target genes."
DB00325,Nitroprusside,CHEMBL2097081,"One molecule of sodium nitroprusside is metabolized by combination with hemoglobin to produce one molecule of cyanmethemoglobin and four CN- ions; methemoglobin, obtained from hemoglobin, can sequester cyanide as cyanmethemoglobin; thiosulfate reacts with cyanide to produce thiocyanate; thiocyanate is eliminated in the urine; cyanide not otherwise removed binds to cytochromes. Cyanide ion is normally found in serum; it is derived from dietary substrates and from tobacco smoke. Cyanide binds avidly (but reversibly) to ferric ion (Fe+++), most body stores of which are found in erythrocyte methemoglobin (metHgb) and in mitochondrial cytochromes. When CN is infused or generated within the bloodstream, essentially all of it is bound to methemoglobin until intraerythrocytic methemoglobin has been saturated.
Once activated to NO, it activates guanylate cyclase in vascular smooth muscle and increases intracellular production of cGMP. cGMP stimulates calcium movement from the cytoplasm to the endoplasmic reticulum and reduces calcium available to bind with calmodulin. This eventually leads to vascular smooth muscle relaxation and vessel dilatation."
DB00326,Calcium Gluceptate,CHEMBL1237066,"Calcium gluceptate replenishes the deminished levels of calcium in the body, returning them to normal levels."
DB00327,Hydromorphone,CHEMBL398707,"Hydromorphone is a narcotic analgesic; its principal therapeutic effect is relief of pain. Hydromorphone interacts predominantly with the opioid mu-receptors. These mu-binding sites are discretely distributed in the human brain, with high densities in the posterior amygdala, hypothalamus, thalamus, nucleus caudatus, putamen, and certain cortical areas. They are also found on the terminal axons of primary afferents within laminae I and II (substantia gelatinosa) of the spinal cord and in the spinal nucleus of the trigeminal nerve. In clinical settings, Hydromorphone exerts its principal pharmacological effect on the central nervous system and gastrointestinal tract. Hydromorphone also binds with kappa-receptors which are thought to mediate spinal analgesia, miosis and sedation."
DB00328,Indomethacin,CHEMBL6,"Indomethacin is a prostaglandin G/H synthase (also known as cyclooxygenase or COX) inhibitor that acts on both prostaglandin G/H synthase 1 and 2 (COX-1 and -2). Prostaglandin G/H synthase catalyzes the conversion of arachidonic acid to a number of prostaglandins involved in fever, pain, swelling, inflammation, and platelet aggregation. Indomethacin antagonizes COX by binding to the upper portion of the active site, preventing its substrate, arachidonic acid, from entering the active site. Indomethacin, unlike other NSAIDs, also inhibits phospholipase A2, the enzyme responsible for releasing arachidonic acid from phospholipids. Indomethacin is more selective for COX-1 than COX-2, which accounts for its increased adverse gastric effects relative to other NSAIDs. COX-1 is required for maintaining the protective gastric mucosal layer. The analgesic, antipyretic and anti-inflammatory effects of indomethacin occur as a result of decreased prostaglandin synthesis. Its antipyretic effects may be due to action on the hypothalamus, resulting in an increased peripheral blood flow, vasodilation, and subsequent heat dissipation."
DB00330,Ethambutol,CHEMBL44884,"Ethambutol inhibits arabinosyl transferases which is involved in cell wall biosynthesis. By inhibiting this enzyme, the bacterial cell wall complex production is inhibited. This leads to an increase in cell wall permeability."
DB00331,Metformin,CHEMBL1431,"Metformin's mechanisms of action differ from other classes of oral antihyperglycemic agents. Metformin decreases blood glucose levels by decreasing hepatic glucose production, decreasing intestinal absorption of glucose, and improving insulin sensitivity by increasing peripheral glucose uptake and utilization. These effects are mediated by the initial activation by metformin of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a liver enzyme that plays an important role in insulin signaling, whole body energy balance, and the metabolism of glucose and fats. Activation of AMPK is required for metformin's inhibitory effect on the production of glucose by liver cells. Increased peripheral utilization of glucose may be due to improved insulin binding to insulin receptors. Metformin administration also increases AMPK activity in skeletal muscle. AMPK is known to cause GLUT4 deployment to the plasma membrane, resulting in insulin-independent glucose uptake. The rare side effect, lactic acidosis, is thought to be caused by decreased liver uptake of serum lactate, one of the substrates of gluconeogenesis. In those with healthy renal function, the slight excess is simply cleared. However, those with severe renal impairment may accumulate clinically significant serum lactic acid levels. Other conditions that may precipitate lactic acidosis include severe hepatic disease and acute/decompensated heart failure.
"
DB00332,Ipratropium bromide,CHEMBL1908368,"Ipratropium bromide is an anticholinergic agent. It blocks muscarinic cholinergic receptors, without specificity for subtypes, resulting in a decrease in the formation of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). Most likely due to actions of cGMP on intracellular calcium, this results in decreased contractility of smooth muscle."
DB00333,Methadone,CHEMBL651,"Methadone is a mu-agonist; a synthetic opioid analgesic with multiple actions qualitatively similar to those of morphine, the most prominent of which involves the central nervous system and organs composed of smooth muscle. The principal therapeutic uses for methadone are for analgesia and for detoxification or maintenance in opioid addiction. The methadone abstinence syndrome, although qualitatively similar to that of morphine, differs in that the onset is slower, the course is more prolonged, and the symptoms are less severe. Some data also indicate that methadone acts as an antagonist at the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor. The contribution of NMDA receptor antagonism to methadone's efficacy is unknown. Other NMDA receptor antagonists have been shown to produce neurotoxic effects in animals."
DB00334,Olanzapine,CHEMBL715,Olanzapine's antipsychotic activity is likely due to a combination of antagonism at D2 receptors in the mesolimbic pathway and 5HT2A receptors in the frontal cortex. Antagonism at D2 receptors relieves positive symptoms while antagonism at 5HT2A receptors relieves negative symptoms of schizophrenia.
DB00335,Atenolol,CHEMBL24,"Like metoprolol, atenolol competes with sympathomimetic neurotransmitters such as catecholamines for binding at beta(1)-adrenergic receptors in the heart and vascular smooth muscle, inhibiting sympathetic stimulation. This results in a reduction in resting heart rate, cardiac output, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and reflex orthostatic hypotension. Higher doses of atenolol also competitively block beta(2)-adrenergic responses in the bronchial and vascular smooth muscles."
DB00336,Nitrofural,CHEMBL869,"The exact mechanism of action is unknown. Nitrofurazone inhibits several bacterial enzymes, especially those involved in the aerobic and anaerobic degradation of glucose and pyruvate. This activity is believed also to affect pyruvate dehydrogenase, citrate synthetase, malate dehydrogenase, glutathione reductase, and pyruvate decarboxylase."
DB00337,Pimecrolimus,CHEMBL1200686,"Pimecrolimus binds with high affinity to macrophilin-12 (FKBP-12) and inhibits the calcium-dependent phosphatase, calcineurin. As a consequence, it inhibits T cell activation by blocking the transcription of early cytokines. In particular, pimecrolimus inhibits at nanomolar concentrations Interleukin-2 and interferon gamma (Th1-type) and Interleukin-4 and Interleukin-10 (Th2-type) cytokine synthesis in human T cells. Also, pimecrolimus prevents the release of inflammatory cytokines and mediators from mast cells in vitro after stimulation by antigen/lgE."
DB00338,Omeprazole,CHEMBL1503,"Omeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor that suppresses gastric acid secretion by specific inhibition of the H<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase in the gastric parietal cell. By acting specifically on the proton pump, omeprazole blocks the final step in acid production, thus reducing gastric acidity."
DB00339,Pyrazinamide,CHEMBL614,"Pyrazinamide diffuses into M. tuberculosis, where the enzyme pyrazinamidase converts pyrazinamide to the active form pyrazinoic acid. Under acidic conditions, the pyrazinoic acid that slowly leaks out converts to the protonated conjugate acid, which is thought to diffuse easily back into the bacilli and accumulate. The net effect is that more pyrazinoic acid accumulates inside the bacillus at acid pH than at neutral pH.
Pyrazinoic acid was thought to inhibit the enzyme fatty acid synthase (FAS) I, which is required by the bacterium to synthesise fatty acids. However, this theory was thought to have been discounted (PMID: 11914348). However, further studies reproduced the results of FAS I inhibition as the putative mechanism first in whole cell assay of replicating M. tuberculosis bacilli which have shown that pyrazinoic acid and its ester inhibit the synthesis of fatty acids (PMID: 17101678). This study was followed by in vitro assay of tuberculous FAS I enzyme that tested the activity with pyrazinamide, pyrazinoic acid and several classes of pyrazinamide analogs. Pyrazinamide and its analogs inhibited the activity of purified FAS I (PMID: 17485499). 

It has also been suggested that the accumulation of pyrazinoic acid disrupts membrane potential and interferes with energy production, necessary for survival of M. tuberculosis at an acidic site of infection. 

Pyrazinoic acid has also been shown to bind to the ribosomal protein S1 (RpsA) and inhibit trans-translation. This may explain the ability of the drug to kill dormant mycobacteria (PMID: 21835980)."
DB00340,Metixene,CHEMBL1201342,"Parkinsonism is thought to result from an imbalance between the excitatory (cholinergic) and inhibitory (dopaminergic) systems in the corpus striatum. The mechanism of action of centrally active anticholinergic drugs such as metixene is considered to relate to competitive antagonism of acetylcholine at muscarinic receptors in the corpus striatum, which then restores the balance."
DB00341,Cetirizine,CHEMBL1000,"Cetirizine competes with histamine for binding at H<sub>1</sub>-receptor sites on the effector cell surface, resulting in suppression of histaminic edema, flare, and pruritus. The low incidence of sedation can be attributed to reduced penetration of cetirizine into the CNS as a result of the less lipophilic carboxyl group on the ethylamine side chain."
DB00342,Terfenadine,CHEMBL17157,"Terfenadine competes with histamine for binding at H1-receptor sites in the GI tract, uterus, large blood vessels, and bronchial muscle. This reversible binding of terfenadine to H1-receptors suppresses the formation of edema, flare, and pruritus resulting from histaminic activity. As the drug does not readily cross the blood-brain barrier, CNS depression is minimal."
DB00343,Diltiazem,CHEMBL23,"Possibly by deforming the channel, inhibiting ion-control gating mechanisms, and/or interfering with the release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, diltiazem, like verapamil, inhibits the influx of extracellular calcium across both the myocardial and vascular smooth muscle cell membranes. The resultant inhibition of the contractile processes of the myocardial smooth muscle cells leads to dilation of the coronary and systemic arteries and improved oxygen delivery to the myocardial tissue."
DB00344,Protriptyline,CHEMBL668,Protriptyline acts by decreasing the reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin (5-HT).
DB00345,Aminohippuric acid,CHEMBL463,Aminohippurate is filtered by the renal glomeruli and secreted into the urine by the proximal tubules. By measuring the amount of drug in the urine it is possible to determine functional capacity and effective renal plasma flow.
DB00346,Alfuzosin,CHEMBL709,"Alfuzosin is a non-subtype specific alpha(1)-adrenergic blocking agent that exhibits selectivity for alpha(1)-adrenergic receptors in the lower urinary tract. Inhibition of these adrenoreceptors leads to the relaxation of smooth muscle in the bladder neck and prostate, resulting in the improvement in urine flow and a reduction in symptoms in benign prostate hyperplasia. Alfuzosin also inhibits the vasoconstrictor effect of circulating and locally released catecholamines (epinephrine and norepinephrine), resulting in peripheral vasodilation."
DB00347,Trimethadione,CHEMBL695,"Dione anticonvulsants reduce T-type calcium currents in thalamic neurons, including thalamic relay neurons. It does so via the inhibition of voltage dependent T-type calcium channels. This raises the threshold for repetitive activity in the thalamus, and inhibits corticothalamic transmission. Thus, the abnormal thalamocortical rhythmicity, which is thought to underlie the 3-Hz spike-and-wave discharge seen on electroencephalogram(EEG) with absence seizures, is dampened."
DB00348,Nitisinone,CHEMBL1337,"Nitisinone is a competitive inhibitor of 4-hydroxyphenyl-pyruvate dioxygenase, an enzyme upstream of fumarylacetoacetate hydrolyase (FAH) in the tyrosine catabolic pathway. By inhibiting the normal catabolism of tyrosine in patients with hereditary tyrosinemia type 1 (HT-1), nitisinone prevents the accumulation of the catabolic intermediates maleylacetoacetate and fumarylacetoacetate."
DB00349,Clobazam,CHEMBL70418,"Clobazam binds at distinct binding sites associated with the chloride ionopore at the post-synaptic GABA receptor. These GABA receptors are in various locations in the CNS (limbic, reticular formation) and clobazam increases the duration of time for which the chloride ionopore is open. As a result, hyper polarization and stabilization of the membrane occur as the post-synaptic inhibitory effect of GABA is enhanced. "
DB00350,Minoxidil,CHEMBL802,"Minoxidil is thought to promote the survival of human dermal papillary cells (DPCs) or hair cells by activating both extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and Akt and by preventing cell death by increasing the ratio of BCl<sup>-</sup>2/Bax. Minoxidil may stimulate the growth of human hairs by prolonging anagen through these proliferative and anti-apoptotic effects on DPCs. Minoxidil, when used as a vasodilator, acts by opening adenosine triphosphate-sensitive potassium channels in vascular smooth muscle cells. This vasodilation may also improve the viability of hair cells or hair follicles."
DB00351,Megestrol acetate,CHEMBL1201139,"The precise mechanism by which megestrol acetate produces effects in anorexia and cachexia is unknown at the present time, but its progestin antitumour activity may involve suppression of luteinizing hormone by inhibition of pituitary function. Studies also suggest that the megestrol's weight gain effect is related to its appetite-stimulant or metabolic effects rather than its glucocorticoid-like effects or the production of edema. It has also been suggested that megestrol may alter metabolic pathyways via interferences with the production or action of mediators such as cachectin, a hormone that inhibits adipocyte lipogenic enzymes. "
DB00352,Tioguanine,CHEMBL727,"Thioguanine competes with hypoxanthine and guanine for the enzyme hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRTase) and is itself converted to 6-thioguanilyic acid (TGMP), which reaches high intracellular concentrations at therapeutic doses. TGMP interferes with the synthesis of guanine nucleotides by its inhibition of purine biosynthesis by pseudofeedback inhibition of glutamine-5-phosphoribosylpyrophosphate amidotransferase, the first enzyme unique to the de novo pathway of purine ribonucleotide synthesis. TGMP also inhibits the conversion of inosinic acid (IMP) to xanthylic acid (XMP) by competition for the enzyme IMP dehydrogenase. Thioguanine nucleotides are incorporated into both the DNA and the RNA by phosphodiester linkages, and some studies have shown that incorporation of such false bases contributes to the cytotoxicity of thioguanine. Its tumor inhibitory properties may be due to one or more of its effects on feedback inhibition of de novo purine synthesis; inhibition of purine nucleotide interconversions; or incorporation into the DNA and RNA. The overall result of its action is a sequential blockade of the utilization and synthesis of the purine nucleotides."
DB00353,Methylergometrine,CHEMBL1201356,"Methylergometrine acts directly on the smooth muscle of the uterus and increases the tone, rate, and amplitude of rhythmic contractions through binding and the resultant antagonism of the dopamine D1 receptor. Thus, it induces a rapid and sustained tetanic uterotonic effect which shortens the third stage of labor and reduces blood loss."
DB00354,Buclizine,CHEMBL1201271,"Vomiting (emesis) is essentially a protective mechanism for removing irritant or otherwise harmful substances from the upper GI tract. Emesis or vomiting is controlled by the vomiting centre in the medulla region of the brain, an important part of which is the chemotrigger zone (CTZ). The vomiting centre possesses neurons which are rich in muscarinic cholinergic and histamine containing synapses. These types of neurons are especially involved in transmission from the vestibular apparatus to the vomiting centre. Motion sickness principally involves overstimulation of these pathways due to various sensory stimuli. Hence the action of buclizine which acts to block the histamine receptors in the vomiting centre and thus reduce activity along these pathways. Furthermore since buclizine possesses anti-cholinergic properties as well, the muscarinic receptors are similarly blocked."
DB00355,Aztreonam,CHEMBL158,"The bactericidal action of aztreonam results from the inhibition of bacterial cell wall synthesis due to a high affinity of aztreonam for penicillin binding protein 3 (PBP3). By binding to PBP3, aztreonam inhibits the third and last stage of bacterial cell wall synthesis. Cell lysis is then mediated by bacterial cell wall autolytic enzymes such as autolysins. It is possible that aztreonam interferes with an autolysin inhibitor."
DB00356,Chlorzoxazone,CHEMBL1371,"Chlorzoxazone inhibits degranulation of mast cells, subsequently preventing the release of histamine and slow-reacting substance of anaphylaxis (SRS-A), mediators of type I allergic reactions. Chlorzoxazone also may reduce the release of inflammatory leukotrienes. Chlorzoxazone may act by inhibiting calcium and potassium influx which would lead to neuronal inhibition and muscle relaxation. Data available from animal experiments as well as human study indicate that chlorzoxazone acts primarily at the level of the spinal cord and subcortical areas of the brain where it inhibits multisynaptic reflex arcs involved in producing and maintaining skeletal muscle spasm"
DB00357,Aminoglutethimide,CHEMBL488,"Aminoglutethimide reduces the production of D5-pregnenolone and blocks several other steps in steroid synthesis, including the C-11, C-18, and C-21 hydroxylations and the hydroxylations required for the aromatization of androgens to estrogens, mediated through the binding of aminoglutethimide to cytochrome P-450 complexes. Specifically, the drug binds to and inhibits aromatase which is essential for the generation of estrogens from androstenedione and testosterone. A decrease in adrenal secretion of cortisol is followed by an increased secretion of pituitary adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), which will overcome the blockade of adrenocortical steroid synthesis by aminoglutethimide. The compensatory increase in ACTH secretion can be suppressed by the simultaneous administration of hydrocortisone. Since aminoglutethimide increases the rate of metabolism of dexamethasone but not that of hydrocortisone, the latter is preferred as the adrenal glucocorticoid replacement. Although aminoglutethimide inhibits the synthesis of thyroxine by the thyroid gland, the compensatory increase in thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) is frequently of sufficient magnitude to overcome the inhibition of thyroid synthesis due to aminoglutethimide. In spite of an increase in TSH, aminoglutethimide has not been associated with increased prolactin secretion."
DB00358,Mefloquine,CHEMBL416956,Mefloquine has been found to produce swelling of the <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> food vacuoles. It may act by forming toxic complexes with free heme that damage membranes and interact with other plasmodial components.
DB00359,Sulfadiazine,CHEMBL439,Sulfadiazine is a competitive inhibitor of the bacterial enzyme dihydropteroate synthetase. This enzyme is needed for the proper processing of para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) which is essential for folic acid synthesis. The inhibited reaction is necessary in these organisms for the synthesis of folic acid.
DB00360,Sapropterin,CHEMBL1201774,"Tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) is a natural co-factor or co-enzyme for phenylalanine-4-hydroxylase (PAH),Tetrahydrobiopterine, and tryptophan-5-hydroxylase. Tetrahydrobiopterin is also a natural co-factor for nitrate oxide synthase. Therefore BH4 is required for the conversion of phenylalanine to tyrosine, for the production of epinephrine (adrenaline) and the synthesis of the monoamine neuro-transmitters, serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine (noradrenaline). It is also involved in apoptosis and other cellular events mediated by nitric oxide production. As a coenzyme, BH4 reacts with molecular oxygen to form an active oxygen intermediate that can hydroxylate substrates. In the hydroxylation process, the co-enzyme loses two electrons and is regenerated in vivo in an NADH-dependent reaction. As a co-factor for PAH, tetrahydrobiopterin allows the conversion of phenylalanine to tyrosine and reduces the level of phenylalanine in the bloodstream, thereby reducing the toxic effects of of this amino acid. Normal serum concentrations of phenylalanine are 100 micomolar, while elevated (toxic) levels are typically >1200 micromolar. Individuals with a deficiency in tetrahydrobiopterin are not able to efficiently convert phenylalanine to tyrosine. The excess levels provided by tetrahydrobiopterin supplementation help improve enzyme efficiency. As a co-factor for tyrosine hydroxylase, BH4 facilitates the conversion of tyrosine to L-dopa while as a co-factor for tryptophan hydroxylase, BH4 allows the conversion of tryptophan to 5-hydroxytryptophan, which is then converted to serotonin."
DB00361,Vinorelbine,CHEMBL607994,"The antitumor activity of vinorelbine is thought to be due primarily to inhibition of mitosis at metaphase through its interaction with tubulin. Vinorelbine binds to the microtubular proteins of the mitotic spindle, leading to crystallization of the microtubule and mitotic arrest or cell death. Like other vinca alkaloids, vinorelbine may also interfere with: 1) amino acid, cyclic AMP, and glutathione metabolism, 2) calmodulin-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup>-transport ATPase activity, 3) cellular respiration, and 4) nucleic acid and lipid biosynthesis."
DB00362,Anidulafungin,CHEMBL264241,"Anidulafungin is a semi-synthetic echinocandin with antifungal activity. Anidulafungin inhibits glucan synthase, an enzyme present in fungal, but not mammalian cells. This results in inhibition of the formation of 1,3-&beta;-D-glucan, an essential component of the fungal cell wall, ultimately leading to osmotic instability and cell death."
DB00363,Clozapine,CHEMBL42,Clozapine's antipsychotic action is likely mediated through a combination of antogistic effects at D2 receptors in the mesolimbic pathway and 5-HT2A receptors in the frontal cortex. D2 antagonism relieves positive symptoms while 5-HT2A antagonism alleviates negative symptoms.
DB00364,Sucralfate,CHEMBL2029132,"Although sucralfate's mechanism is not entirely understood, there are several factors that most likely contribute to its action. Sucralfate, with its strong negative charge, binds to exposed positively-charged proteins at the base of ulcers. In this way, it coats the ulcer and forms a physical barrier that protects the ulcer surface from further injury by acid and pepsin. It directly inhibits pepsin (an enzyme that breaks apart proteins) in the presence of stomach acid and binds bile salts coming from the liver via the bile thus protecting the stomach lining from injury caused by the bile acids. Sucralfate may increase prostaglandin production. Prostaglandins are known to protect the lining of the stomach and may also bind epithelial growth factor and fibroblast growth factor, both of which enhance the growth and repair mechanism of the stomach lining."
DB00365,Grepafloxacin,CHEMBL583,"Grepafloxacin exerts its antibacterial activity by inhibiting bacterial topoisomerase II (DNA gyrase) and topoisomerase IV, essential enzymes for duplication, transcription, and repair of bacterial DNA."
DB00366,Doxylamine,CHEMBL1004,"Like other antihistamines, doxylamine acts by competitively inhibiting histamine at H1&nbsp;receptors. It also has substantial sedative and anticholinergic effects."
DB00367,Levonorgestrel,CHEMBL1389,"Binds to the progesterone and estrogen receptors. Target cells include the female reproductive tract, the mammary gland, the hypothalamus, and the pituitary. Once bound to the receptor, progestins like levonorgestrel will slow the frequency of release of gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) from the hypothalamus and blunt the pre-ovulatory LH (luteinizing hormone) surge."
DB00368,Norepinephrine,CHEMBL1437,Norepinephrine functions as a peripheral vasoconstrictor by acting on alpha-adrenergic receptors. It is also an inotropic stimulator of the heart and dilator of coronary arteries as a result of it's activity at the beta-adrenergic receptors.
DB00369,Cidofovir,CHEMBL152,"Cidofovir acts through the selective inhibition of viral DNA polymerase.Biochemical data support selective inhibition of CMV DNA polymerase by cidofovir diphosphate, the active intracellular metabolite of cidofovir. Cidofovir diphosphate inhibits herpesvirus polymerases at concentrations that are 8- to 600-fold lower than those needed to inhibit human cellular DNA polymerase alpha, beta, and gamma(1,2,3). Incorporation of cidofovir into the growing viral DNA chain results in reductions in the rate of viral DNA synthesis."
DB00370,Mirtazapine,CHEMBL654,"Mirtazapine acts as an antagonist at central pre-synaptic alpha(2)-receptors, inhibiting negative feedback to the presynaptic nerve and causing an increase in NE release. Blockade of heteroreceptors, alpha(2)-receptors contained in serotenergic neurons, enhances the release of 5-HT, increasing the interactions between 5-HT and 5-HT<sub>1</sub> receptors and contributing to the anxiolytic effects of mirtazapine. Mirtazapine also acts as a weak antagonist at 5-HT<sub>1</sub> receptors and as a potent antagonist at 5-HT<sub>2</sub> (particularly subtypes 2A and 2C) and 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptors. Blockade of these receptors may explain the lower incidence of adverse effects such as anxiety, insomnia, and nausea. Mirtazapine also exhibits significant antagonism at H1-receptors, resulting in sedation. Mirtazapine has no effects on the reuptake of either NE or 5-HT and has only minimal activity at dopaminergic and muscarinic receptors."
DB00371,Meprobamate,CHEMBL979,"Meprobamate's mechanism of action is not known. It has been shown in animal studies to have effects at multiple sites in the central nervous system, including the thalamus and limbic system. Meprobamate binds to GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors which interrupt neuronal communication in the reticular formation and spinal cord, causing sedation and altered perception of pain."
DB00372,Thiethylperazine,CHEMBL1378,"Thiethylperazine is an antagonist at types 1, 2, and 4 dopamine receptors, 5-HT receptor types 2A and 2C, muscarinic receptors 1 through 5, alpha(1)-receptors, and histamine H1-receptors. Thiethylperazine's antipsychotic effect is due to antagonism at dopamine and serotonin type 2 receptors, with greater activity at serotonin 5-HT2 receptors than at dopamine type-2 receptors. This may explain the lack of extrapyramidal effects. Thiethylperazine does not appear to block dopamine within the tubero-infundibular tract, explaining the lower incidence of hyperprolactinemia than with typical antipsychotic agents or risperidone. Antagonism at muscarinic receptors, H1-receptors, and alpha(1)-receptors also occurs with thiethylperazine."
DB00373,Timolol,CHEMBL499,"Like propranolol and nadolol, timolol competes with adrenergic neurotransmitters such as catecholamines for binding at beta(1)-adrenergic receptors in the heart and vascular smooth muscle and beta(2)-receptors in the bronchial and vascular smooth muscle. Beta(1)-receptor blockade results in a decrease in resting and exercise heart rate and cardiac output, a decrease in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and, possibly, a reduction in reflex orthostatic hypotension. Beta(2)-blockade results in an increase in peripheral vascular resistance. The exact mechanism whereby timolol reduces ocular pressure is still not known. The most likely action is by decreasing the secretion of aqueous humor."
DB00374,Treprostinil,CHEMBL1237119,"The major pharmacological actions of treprostinil are direct vasodilation of pulmonary and systemic arterial vascular beds and inhibition of platelet aggregation. In addition to treprostinil's direct vasodilatory effects, it also inhibits inflammatory cytokine. As a synthetic analogue of prostacyclin, it binds to the prostacyclin receptor, which subsequently induces the aforementioned downstream effects."
DB00375,Colestipol,CHEMBL1909303,"Colestipol is a non-absorbed, lipid-lowering polymer that binds bile acids in the intestine, impeding their reabsorption. As the bile acid pool becomes depleted, the hepatic enzyme, cholesterol 7-(alpha)-hydroxylase, is upregulated, which increases the conversion of cholesterol to bile acids. This causes an increased demand for cholesterol in the liver cells, resulting in the dual effect of increasing transcription and activity of the cholesterol biosynthetic enzyme, hydroxymethyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, and increasing the number of hepatic low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors. These compensatory effects result in increased clearance of LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) from the blood, resulting in decreased serum LDL-C levels. Serum triglyceride levels may increase or remain unchanged. The end result is increased clearance of LDL-cholesterol from the blood with decreased serum LDL-cholesterol."
DB00376,Trihexyphenidyl,CHEMBL1490,"Trihexyphenidyl is a selective M1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist. It is able to discriminate between the M1 (cortical or neuronal) and the peripheral muscarinic subtypes (cardiac and glandular). Trihexyphenidyl partially blocks cholinergic activity in the CNS, which is responsible for the symptoms of Parkinson's disease. It is also thought to increase the availability of dopamine, a brain chemical that is critical in the initiation and smooth control of voluntary muscle movement."
DB00377,Palonosetron,CHEMBL1189679,"Palonosetron is a selective serotonin 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor antagonist. The antiemetic activity of the drug is brought about through the inhibition of 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptors present both centrally (medullary chemoreceptor zone) and peripherally (GI tract). This inhibition of 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptors in turn inhibits the visceral afferent stimulation of the vomiting center, likely indirectly at the level of the area postrema, as well as through direct inhibition of serotonin activity within the area postrema and the chemoreceptor trigger zone. Alternative mechanisms appear to be primarily responsible for delayed nausea and vomiting induced by emetogenic chemotherapy, since similar temporal relationships between between serotonin and emesis beyond the first day after a dose have not been established, and 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor antagonists generally have not appeared to be effective alone in preventing or ameliorating delayed effects. It has been hypothesized that palonosetron's potency and long plasma half-life may contribute to its observed efficacy in preventing delayed nausea and vomiting caused by moderately emetogenic cancer chemotherapy."
DB00378,Dydrogesterone,CHEMBL1200853,Dydrogesterone is a progestogen that works by regulating the healthy growth and normal shedding of the womb lining by acting on progesterone receptors in the uterus.
DB00379,Mexiletine,CHEMBL558,"Mexiletine, like lidocaine, inhibits the inward sodium current required for the initiation and conduction of impulses, thus reducing the rate of rise of the action potential, Phase 0. It achieves this reduced sodium current by inhibiting sodium channels. Mexiletine decreases the effective refractory period (ERP) in Purkinje fibers in the heart. The decrease in ERP is of lesser magnitude than the decrease in action potential duration (APD), which results in an increase in the ERP/APD ratio. It does not significantly affect resting membrane potential or sinus node automaticity, left ventricular function, systolic arterial blood pressure, atrioventricular (AV) conduction velocity, or QRS or QT intervals"
DB00380,Dexrazoxane,CHEMBL1738,"The mechanism by which dexrazoxane exerts its cardioprotective activity is not fully understood. Dexrazoxane is a cyclic derivative of EDTA that readily penetrates cell membranes. Results of laboratory studies suggest that dexrazoxane (a prodrug) is converted intracellularly to a ring-opened bidentate chelating agent that chelates to free iron and interferes with iron-mediated free radical generation thought to be responsible, in part, for anthracycline-induced cardiomyopathy. It should be noted that dexrazoxane may also be protective through its inhibitory effect on topoisomerase II."
DB00381,Amlodipine,CHEMBL1491,"Amlodipine decreases arterial smooth muscle contractility and subsequent vasoconstriction by inhibiting the influx of calcium ions through L-type calcium channels. Calcium ions entering the cell through these channels bind to calmodulin. Calcium-bound calmodulin then binds to and activates myosin light chain kinase (MLCK). Activated MLCK catalyzes the phosphorylation of the regulatory light chain subunit of myosin, a key step in muscle contraction. Signal amplification is achieved by calcium-induced calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum through ryanodine receptors. Inhibition of the initial influx of calcium decreases the contractile activity of arterial smooth muscle cells and results in vasodilation. The vasodilatory effects of amlodipine result in an overall decrease in blood pressure. Amlodipine is a long-acting CCB that may be used to treat mild to moderate essential hypertension and exertion-related angina (chronic stable angina). Another possible mechanism is that amlodipine inhibits vascular smooth muscle carbonic anhydrase I activity causing cellular pH increases which may be involved in regulating intracelluar calcium influx through calcium channels."
DB00382,Tacrine,CHEMBL95,"The mechanism of tacrine is not fully known, but it is suggested that the drug is an anticholinesterase agent which reversibly binds with and inactivates cholinesterases. This inhibits the hydrolysis of acetylcholine released from functioning cholinergic neurons, thus leading to an accumulation of acetylcholine at cholinergic synapses. The result is a prolonged effect of acetylcholine."
DB00383,Oxyphencyclimine,CHEMBL1495,"Oxyphencyclimine binds the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor. It may block all three types of muscarinic receptors including M-1 receptors in the CNS and ganglia, M-2 receptors in the heart (vagus) and M-3 receptors at the parasympathetic NEJ system. The muscarinic acetylcholine receptors mediate various cellular responses, including inhibition of adenylate cyclase, breakdown of phosphoinositides and modulation of potassium channels through the action of G proteins. Oxphencyclimine inhibits vagally mediated reflexes by antagonizing the action of acetylcholine. This in turn reduces the secretion of gastric acids in the stomach."
DB00384,Triamterene,CHEMBL585,"Triamterene inhibits the epithelial sodium channels on principal cells in the late distal convoluted tubule and collecting tubule, which are responsible for 1-2% of total sodium reabsorption. As sodium reabsorption is inhibited, this increases the osmolarity in the nephron lumen and decreases the osmolarity of the interstitium. Since sodium concentration is the main driving force for water reabsorption, triamterene can achieve a modest amount of diuresis by decreasing the osmotic gradient necessary for water reabsorption from lumen to interstitium. Triamterene also has a potassium-sparing effect. Normally, the process of potassium excretion is driven by the electrochemical gradient produced by sodium reabsorption. As sodium is reabsorbed, it leaves a negative potential in the lumen, while producing a positive potential in the principal cell. This potential promotes potassium excretion through apical potassium channels. By inhibiting sodium reabsorption, triamterene also inhibits potassium excretion. "
DB00385,Valrubicin,CHEMBL1096885,"Valrubicin is an anthracycline that affects a variety of inter-related biological functions, most of which involve nucleic acid metabolism. It readily penetrates into cells, where after DNA intercalation, it inhibits the incorporation of nucleosides into nucleic acids, causes extensive chromosomal damage, and arrests cell cycle in G2. Although valrubicin does not bind strongly to DNA, a principal mechanism of its action, mediated by valrubicin metabolites, is interference with the normal DNA breaking-resealing action of DNA topoisomerase II."
DB00387,Procyclidine,CHEMBL86715,"The mechanism of action is unknown. It is thought that Procyclidine acts by blocking central cholinergic receptors, and thus balancing cholinergic and dopaminergic activity in the basal ganglia. Many of its effects are due to its pharmacologic similarities with atropine. Procyclidine exerts an antispasmodic effect on smooth muscle, and may produce mydriasis and reduction in salivation."
DB00388,Phenylephrine,CHEMBL1215,"In general, &alpha;<sub>1</sub>-adrenergic receptors mediate contraction and hypertrophic growth of smooth muscle cells. &alpha;<sub>1</sub>-receptors are 7-transmembrane domain receptors coupled to G proteins, G<sub>q/11</sub>. Three &alpha;<sub>1</sub>-receptor subtypes, which share approximately 75% homology in their transmembrane domains, have been identified: &alpha;<sub>1A</sub> (chromosome 8), &alpha;<sub>1B</sub> (chromosome 5), and &alpha;<sub>1D</sub> (chromosome 20). Phenylephrine appears to act similarly on all three receptor subtypes. All three receptor subtypes appear to be involved in maintaining vascular tone. The &alpha;<sub>1A</sub>-receptor maintains basal vascular tone while the &alpha;<sub>1B</sub>-receptor mediates the vasocontrictory effects of exogenous &alpha;<sub>1</sub>-agonists. Activation of the &alpha;<sub>1</sub>-receptor activates G<sub>q</sub>-proteins, which results in intracellular stimulation of phospholipases C, A<sub>2</sub>, and D. This results in mobilization of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from intracellular stores, activation of mitogen-activated kinase and PI<sub>3</sub> kinase pathways and subsequent vasoconstriction. Phenylephrine produces its local and systemic actions by acting on &alpha;<sub>1</sub>-adrenergic receptors peripheral vascular smooth muscle. Stimulation of the &alpha;<sub>1</sub>-adrenergic receptors results in contraction arteriolar smooth muscle in the periphery. Phenylephrine decreases nasal congestion by acting on &alpha;<sub>1</sub>-adrenergic receptors in the arterioles of the nasal mucosa to produce constriction; this leads to decreased edema and increased drainage of the sinus cavities.

DB00389,Carbimazole,CHEMBL508102,"Carbimazole is an aitithyroid agent that decreases the uptake and concentration of inorganic iodine by thyroid, it also reduces the formation of di-iodotyrosine and thyroxine. Once converted to its active form of methimazole, it prevents the thyroid peroxidase enzyme from coupling and iodinating the tyrosine residues on thyroglobulin, hence reducing the production of the thyroid hormones T3 and T4."
DB00390,Digoxin,CHEMBL1751,"Digoxin inhibits the Na-K-ATPase membrane pump, resulting in an increase in intracellular sodium. The sodium calcium exchanger (NCX)in turn tries to extrude the sodium and in so doing, pumps in more calcium. Increased intracellular concentrations of calcium may promote activation of contractile proteins (e.g., actin, myosin). Digoxin also acts on the electrical activity of the heart, increasing the slope of phase 4 depolarization, shortening the action potential duration, and decreasing the maximal diastolic potential."
DB00391,Sulpiride,CHEMBL26,"In contrast to most other neuroleptics which block both dopamine D1 and D2 receptors, Sulpiride is more selective and acts primarily as a dopamine D2 antagonist. Sulpiride appears to lack effects on norepinephrine, acetylcholine, serotonin, histamine, or gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors."
DB00392,Ethopropazine,CHEMBL1206,"Ethopropazine's antiparkinson action can be attributed to its anticholinergic properties. Ethopropazine partially blocks central (striatal) cholinergic receptors, thereby helping to balance cholinergic and dopaminergic activity in the basal ganglia; salivation may be decreased, and smooth muscle may be relaxed. Drug-induced extrapyramidal symptoms and those due to parkinsonism may be relieved, but tardive dyskinesia is not alleviated and may be aggravated by anticholinergic effects. Ethopropazine's local anesthetic effect is due to its antagonism of the NMDA glutamate receptor. Glutamate is recognized as an important transmitter in nociceptive pathways, and the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) subtype of the glutamate receptor, in particular, has been implicated in the mediation of neuropathic pain. Excessive release of glutamate at NMDA receptors on dorsal horn neurons of the spinal cord results in hyperactivation and hypersensitivity of these receptors (perceived as hyperalgesia), thought to be an integral feature of neuropathic pain."
DB00393,Nimodipine,CHEMBL1428,"Although the precise mechanism of action is not known, nimodipine blocks intracellular influx of calcium through voltage-dependent and receptor-operated slow calcium channels across the membranes of myocardial, vascular smooth muscle, and neuronal cells. Nimodipine binds specifically to L-type voltage-gated calcium channels. The inhibition of calcium ion transfer results in the inhibition of vascular smooth muscle contraction. Evidence suggests that the dilation of small cerebral resistance vessels, with a resultant increase in collateral circulation, and/or a direct effect involving the prevention of calcium overload in neurons may be responsible for nimodipine's clinical effect in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage."
DB00394,Beclomethasone dipropionate,CHEMBL1200500,"Unbound corticosteroids cross cell membranes and bind with high affinity to specific cytoplasmic receptors. The result includes inhibition of leukocyte infiltration at the site of inflammation, interference in the function of mediators of inflammatory response, suppression of humoral immune responses, and reduction in edema or scar tissue. The antiinflammatory actions of corticosteroids are thought to involve phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins, lipocortins, which control the biosynthesis of potent mediators of inflammation such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes.

For the investigated use in the treatment of GvHD or Crohn's, beclometasone acts by binding to interleukin-13 to inhibit cytokines, which in turn inhibits inflammatory chemicals downstream."
DB00395,Carisoprodol,CHEMBL1233,"Carisoprodol is a central nervous system depressant that acts as a sedative and skeletal muscle relaxant. Rather than acting directly on skeletal muscle, carisoprodol interrupts neuronal communication within the reticular formation and spinal cord, resulting in sedation and alteration in pain perception. Its exact mechanism of action is not yet known."
DB00396,Progesterone,CHEMBL103,"Progesterone shares the pharmacological actions of the progestins. Progesterone binds to the progesterone and estrogen receptors. Target cells include the female reproductive tract, the mammary gland, the hypothalamus, and the pituitary. Once bound to the receptor, progestins like Progesterone will slow the frequency of release of gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) from the hypothalamus and blunt the pre-ovulatory LH (luteinizing hormone) surge. In women who have adequate endogenous estrogen, progesterone transforms a proliferative endometrium into a secretory one. Progesterone is essential for the development of decidual tissue and is necessary to increase endometrial receptivity for implantation of an embryo. Once an embryo has been implanted, progesterone acts to maintain the pregnancy. Progesterone also stimulates the growth of mammary alveolar tissue and relaxes uterine smooth muscle. It has little estrogenic and androgenic activity."
DB00397,Phenylpropanolamine,CHEMBL2092846,"Phenylpropanolamine acts directly on alpha- and, to a lesser degree, beta-adrenergic receptors in the mucosa of the respiratory tract. Stimulation of alpha-adrenergic receptors produces vasoconstriction, reduces tissue hyperemia, edema, and nasal congestion, and increases nasal airway patency. PPA indirectly stimulates beta-receptors, producing tachycardia and a positive inotropic effect."
DB00398,Sorafenib,CHEMBL1336,"Sorafenib interacts with multiple intracellular (CRAF, BRAF and mutant BRAF) and cell surface kinases (KIT, FLT-3, VEGFR-2, VEGFR-3, and PDGFR-&szlig;). Several of these kinases are thought to be involved in angiogenesis, thus sorafenib reduces blood flow to the tumor. Sorafenib is unique in targeting the Raf/Mek/Erk pathway. By inhibiting these kinases, genetic transcription involving cell proliferation and angiogenesis is inhibited."
DB00399,Zoledronic acid,CHEMBL924,"The action of zoledronate on bone tissue is based partly on its affinity for hydroxyapatite, which is part of the mineral matrix of bone. Zoledronate also targets farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) synthase. Nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates such as zoledronate appear to act as analogues of isoprenoid diphosphate lipids, thereby inhibiting FPP synthase, an enzyme in the mevalonate pathway. Inhibition of this enzyme in osteoclasts prevents the biosynthesis of isoprenoid lipids (FPP and GGPP) that are essential for the post-translational farnesylation and geranylgeranylation of small GTPase signalling proteins. This activity inhibits osteoclast activity and reduces bone resorption and turnover. In postmenopausal women, it reduces the elevated rate of bone turnover, leading to, on average, a net gain in bone mass."
DB00400,Griseofulvin,CHEMBL562,"Griseofulvin is fungistatic, however the exact mechanism by which it inhibits the growth of dermatophytes is not clear. It is thought to inhibit fungal cell mitosis and nuclear acid synthesis. It also binds to and interferes with the function of spindle and cytoplasmic microtubules by binding to alpha and beta tubulin. It binds to keratin in human cells, then once it reaches the fungal site of action, it binds to fungal microtubes thus altering the fungal process of mitosis."
DB00401,Nisoldipine,CHEMBL1726,"By deforming the channel, inhibiting ion-control gating mechanisms, and/or interfering with the release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, Nisoldipine inhibits the influx of extracellular calcium across the myocardial and vascular smooth muscle cell membranes The decrease in intracellular calcium inhibits the contractile processes of the myocardial smooth muscle cells, causing dilation of the coronary and systemic arteries, increased oxygen delivery to the myocardial tissue, decreased total peripheral resistance, decreased systemic blood pressure, and decreased afterload."
DB00402,Eszopiclone,CHEMBL1522,The mechanism of action of Eszopiclone is not completely understood. It is thought that Eszopiclone acts on the benzodiazepine receptors as an agonist and interacts with GABA-receptor complexes.
DB00403,Ceruletide,CHEMBL1201355,"Caerulein acts according to its similarity to the natural gastrointestinal peptide hormone cholecystokinin. Cholecystokinin is a peptide hormone of the gastrointestinal system responsible for stimulating the digestion of fat and protein. Cholecystokinin is secreted by the duodenum, the first segment of the small intestine. There it binds to CCK receptors, activating them and causing downstream effects. Specifically, it results in the release of digestive enzymes and bile from the pancreas and gall bladder, respectively. It also acts as a hunger suppresant. Cholecystokinin is secreted by the duodenum when fat- or protein-rich chyme leaves the stomach and enters the duodenum. The hormone acts on the pancreas to stimulate the secretion of the enzymes lipase, amylase, trypsin, and chymotrypsin. Together these pancreatic enzymes catalyze the digestion of fat and protein. Cholecystokinin also stimulates both the contraction of the gall bladder, and the relaxtion of the Sphincter of Oddi (Glisson's Sphinctor), which delivers, (not secretes) bile into the small intestine. Bile salts serve to emulsify fats, thereby increasing the effectiveness with which enzymes can digest them."
DB00404,Alprazolam,CHEMBL661,"Benzodiazepines bind nonspecifically to benzodiazepine receptors BNZ1, which mediates sleep, and BNZ2, which affects muscle relaxation, anticonvulsant activity, motor coordination, and memory. As benzodiazepine receptors are thought to be coupled to gamma-aminobutyric acid-A (GABA<sub>A</sub>) receptors, this enhances the effects of GABA by increasing GABA affinity for the GABA receptor. Binding of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA to the site opens the chloride channel, resulting in a hyperpolarized cell membrane that prevents further excitation of the cell."
DB00405,Dexbrompheniramine,CHEMBL1201287,"Dexbrompheniramine competitively binds to the histamine H<sub>1</sub>-receptor. It competes with histamine for the normal H<sub>1</sub>-receptor sites on effector cells of the gastrointestinal tract, blood vessels and respiratory tract. This blocks the action of endogenous histamine, which subsequently leads to temporary relief of the negative symptoms brought on by histamine."
DB00406,Gentian Violet,CHEMBL459265,"In aqueous solutions Gentian violet (GV) dissociates into positive (GV+)and negative ions (Cl-) that penetrate through the wall and membrane of both gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial cells. The GV+ interacts with negatively charged components of bacterial cells including the lipopolysaccharide (on the cell wall), the peptidoglycan and DNA. A similar cell penetration and DNA binding process is thought to take place for fungal cells as well. Because Gentian violet is a mutagen and mitotic poison, cell growth is consequently inhibited. A photodynamic action of gentian violet, apparently mediated by a free-radical mechanism, has recently been described in bacteria and in the protozoan T. cruzi. Evidence also suggests that gentian violet dissipates the bacterial (and mitochondrial) membrane potential by inducing permeability. This is followed by respiratory inhibition. This anti-mitochondrial activity might explain gentian violet's efficacy towards both bacteria and yeast with relatively mild effects on mammalian cells."
DB00407,Ardeparin,,"Ardeparin binds to antithrombin III, accelerating its activity in inactivating factor Xa and thrombin, thereby inhibiting thrombosis. Ardeparin also binds to heparin cofactor II, inhibiting thrombin. Ardeparin does not effect prothrombin time (PT) assays and may prolong activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT). Ardeparin has double the anti-factor Xa activity versus anti-factor IIa activity, compared to unfractionated heparin which has approximately equal anti-factor Xa activity and anti-factor IIa activity."
DB00408,Loxapine,CHEMBL831,"Loxapine is a dopamine antagonist, and also a serotonin 5-HT2 blocker. The exact mode of action of Loxapine has not been established, however changes in the level of excitability of subcortical inhibitory areas have been observed in several animal species in association with such manifestations of tranquilization as calming effects and suppression of aggressive behavior."
DB00409,Remoxipride,CHEMBL22242,"Remoxipride acts as an antagonist at the D2 dopamine receptor. It is believed that overactivity of dopamine systems in the mesolimbic pathway may contribute to the ""positive symptoms"" of schizophrenia (such as delusions and hallucinations), whereas problems with dopamine function in the mesocortical pathway may be responsible for the ""negative symptoms"", such as avolition, flat emotional response and alogia. Therefore, by decreasing the levels of dopamine in these pathways, it is thought that remoxipride is able to reduce the symptoms of schizophrenia, particularily the ""positive symptoms""."
DB00410,Mupirocin,CHEMBL719,"Mupirocin reversibly binds to bacterial isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase, an enzyme which promotes the conversion of isoleucine and tRNA to isoleucyl-tRNA. Prevention of this enzymes from functioning properly  results in the inhibition of bacterial protein and RNA synthesis."
DB00411,Carbachol,CHEMBL14,Carbachol is a parasympathomimetic that stimulates both muscarinic and nicotinic receptors. In topical ocular and intraocular administration its principal effects are miosis and increased aqueous humour outflow.
DB00412,Rosiglitazone,CHEMBL121,"Rosiglitazone acts as a highly selective and potent agonist at peroxisome proliferator activated receptors (PPAR) in target tissues for insulin action such as adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, and liver. Activation of PPAR-gamma receptors regulates the transcription of insulin-responsive genes involved in the control of glucose production, transport, and utilization. In this way, rosiglitazone enhances tissue sensitivity to insulin."
DB00413,Pramipexole,CHEMBL301265,"The precise mechanism of action of Pramipexole as a treatment for Parkinson's disease is unknown, although it is believed to be related to its ability to stimulate dopamine receptors in the striatum."
DB00414,Acetohexamide,CHEMBL1589,"Sulfonylureas such as acetohexamide bind to an ATP-dependent K<sup>+</sup> channel on the cell membrane of pancreatic beta cells. This inhibits a tonic, hyperpolarizing outflux of potassium, which causes the electric potential over the membrane to become more positive. This depolarization opens voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels. The rise in intracellular calcium leads to increased fusion of insulin granulae with the cell membrane, and therefore increased secretion of (pro)insulin."
DB00415,Ampicillin,CHEMBL174,"By binding to specific penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) located inside the bacterial cell wall, Ampicillin inhibits the third and last stage of bacterial cell wall synthesis. Cell lysis is then mediated by bacterial cell wall autolytic enzymes such as autolysins; it is possible that Ampicillin interferes with an autolysin inhibitor."
DB00416,Metocurine Iodide,CHEMBL1739,"Metocurine iodide antagonizes the neurotransmitter action of acetylcholine by binding competitively with cholinergic receptor sites on the motor end-plate. This antagonism is inhibited, and neuromuscular block reversed, by acetylcholinesterase inhibitors such as neostigmine, edrophonium, and pyridostigmine."
DB00417,Phenoxymethylpenicillin,CHEMBL615,"By binding to specific penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) located inside the bacterial cell wall, Penicillin V inhibits the third and last stage of bacterial cell wall synthesis. Cell lysis is then mediated by bacterial cell wall autolytic enzymes such as autolysins; it is possible that Penicillin V interferes with an autolysin inhibitor."
DB00418,Secobarbital,CHEMBL447,"Secobarbital binds at a distinct binding site associated with a Cl<sup>-</sup> ionopore at the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor, increasing the duration of time for which the Cl<sup>-</sup> ionopore is open. The post-synaptic inhibitory effect of GABA in the thalamus is, therefore, prolonged."
DB00419,Miglustat,CHEMBL1029,"Miglustat functions as a competitive and reversible inhibitor of the enzyme glucosylceramide synthase, the initial enzyme in a series of reactions which results in the synthesis of most glycosphingolipids. The goal of treatment with miglustat is to reduce the rate of glycosphingolipid biosynthesis so that the amount of glycosphingolipid substrate is reduced to a level which allows the residual activity of the deficient glucocerebrosidase enzyme to be more effective (substrate reduction therapy), reducing the accumulation of glucocerebroside in macrophages. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that miglustat can reduce the synthesis of glucosylceramide-based glycosphingolipids. In clinical trials, miglustat improved liver and spleen volume, as well as hemoglobin concentration and platelet count. Inhibition of glycosphingolipid synthesis has also shown to reduce intracellular lipid storage, improve fluid-phase endosomal uptake and normalize lipid transport in peripheral blood B lymphocytes of NP-C patients, which results in a decrease in the potentially neurotoxic accumulation of gnagliosides G<sub>M2</sub> and G<sub>M3</sub>, lactosylceramide and glucosylceramide, possibly preventing further neuronal damage. Other studies have also suggested that miglustat may indirectly modulate intracellular calcium homeostasis through its effects on glucosylceramide levels, and evidence has shown that an initiating factor in the pathogenesis of NP-C may be impaired calcium homeostasis related to sphingosine storage. Therefore, the effect that miglustat exerts on intracellular calcium levels may influence an important underlying pathogenic mechanism of NP-C."
DB00420,Promazine,CHEMBL564,"Promazine is an antagonist at types 1, 2, and 4 dopamine receptors, 5-HT receptor types 2A and 2C, muscarinic receptors 1 through 5, alpha(1)-receptors, and histamine H1-receptors. Promazine's antipsychotic effect is due to antagonism at dopamine and serotonin type 2 receptors, with greater activity at serotonin 5-HT2 receptors than at dopamine type-2 receptors. This may explain the lack of extrapyramidal effects. Promazine does not appear to block dopamine within the tubero-infundibular tract, explaining the lower incidence of hyperprolactinemia than with typical antipsychotic agents or risperidone. Antagonism at muscarinic receptors, H1-receptors, and alpha(1)-receptors also occurs with promazine."
DB00421,Spironolactone,CHEMBL1393,"Spironolactone is a specific pharmacologic antagonist of aldosterone, acting primarily through competitive binding of receptors at the aldosterone-dependent sodium-potassium exchange site in the distal convoluted renal tubule. Spironolactone causes increased amounts of sodium and water to be excreted, while potassium is retained. Spironolactone acts both as a diuretic and as an antihypertensive drug by this mechanism. It may be given alone or with other diuretic agents which act more proximally in the renal tubule. Aldosterone interacts with a cytoplasmic mineralocorticoid receptor to enhance the expression of the Na+, K+-ATPase and the Na+ channel involved in a Na+ K+ transport in the distal tubule . Spironolactone bind to this mineralcorticoid receptor, blocking the actions of aldosterone on gene expression. Aldosterone is a hormone; its primary function is to retain sodium and excrete potassium in the kidneys."
DB00422,Methylphenidate,CHEMBL796,Methylphenidate blocks dopamine uptake in central adrenergic neurons by blocking dopamine transport or carrier proteins. Methylphenidate acts at the brain stem arousal system and the cerebral cortex and causes increased sympathomimetic activity in the central nervous system. Alteration of serotonergic pathways via changes in dopamine transport may result.
DB00423,Methocarbamol,CHEMBL1201117,"The mechanism of action of methocarbamol in humans has not been established, but may be due to central nervous system depression. It has no direct action on the contractile mechanism of striated muscle, the motor end plate or the nerve fiber."
DB00424,Hyoscyamine,CHEMBL1331216,"Hyoscyamine competes favorably with acetylcholine for binding at muscarinic receptors in the salivary, bronchial, and sweat glands as well as in the eye, heart, and gastrointestinal tract. The actions of hyoscyamine result in a reduction in salivary, bronchial, gastric and sweat gland secretions, mydriasis, cycloplegia, change in heart rate, contraction of the bladder detrusor muscle and of the gastrointestinal smooth muscle, and decreased gastrointestinal motility."
DB00425,Zolpidem,CHEMBL911,"Zolpidem modulates the alpha-subunit, known as the benzodiazepine receptor, within the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor chloride channel macromolecular complex. Unlike the benzodiazepines, which non-selectively interact with all three alpha-receptor subtypes, Zolpidem preferentially binds to the alpha-1 receptor."
DB00426,Famciclovir,CHEMBL880,"Famciclovir undergoes rapid biotransformation to the active antiviral compound penciclovir, which has inhibitory activity against herpes simplex virus types 1 (HSV-1) and 2 (HSV-2) and varicella zoster virus (VZV). In cells infected with HSV-1, HSV-2 or VZV, viral thymidine kinase phosphorylates penciclovir to a monophosphate form that, in turn, is converted to penciclovir triphosphate by cellular kinases. In vitro studies demonstrate that penciclovir triphosphate inhibits HSV-2 DNA polymerase competitively with deoxyguanosine triphosphate. Consequently, herpes viral DNA synthesis and, therefore, replication are selectively inhibited."
DB00427,Triprolidine,CHEMBL855,"Triprolidine binds to the histamine H1 receptor. This blocks the action of endogenous histamine, which subsequently leads to temporary relief of the negative symptoms brought on by histamine."
DB00428,Streptozocin,CHEMBL1603,"Although its mechanism of action is not completely clear, streptozocin is known to inhibit DNA synthesis, interfere with biochemical reactions of NAD and NADH, and inhibit some enzymes involved in gluconeogenesis. Its activity appears to occur as a result of formation of methylcarbonium ions, which alkylate or bind with many intracellular molecular structures including nucleic acids. Its cytotoxic action is probably due to cross-linking of strands of DNA, resulting in inhibition of DNA synthesis."
DB00429,Carboprost Tromethamine,CHEMBL1237105,"Carboprost is a synthetic prostaglandin. It binds the prostaglandin E2 receptor, causing myometrial contractions, casuing the induction of labour or the expulsion of the placenta. Prostaglandins occur naturally in the body and act at several sites in the body including the womb (uterus). They act on the muscles of the womb, causing them to contract."
DB00430,Cefpiramide,CHEMBL1201204,The bactericidal activity of cefpiramide results from the inhibition of cell wall synthesis via affinity for penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs).
DB00431,Lindane,CHEMBL15891,"Lindane is an organochloride insecticide that has similar neurotoxic protperties to DDT. It exerts its parasiticidal action by being directly absorbed through the parasite's exoskeleton (primarily lice, or scabies) and their ova. The gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA(1)) receptor/chloride ionophore complex is the primary site of action for lindane, and other insecticides such as endosulfan, and fipronil. Blockage of the GABA-gated chloride channel reduces neuronal inhibition, which leads to hyperexcitation of the central nervous system. This results in paralysis, convulsions, and death. Lindane has very low ovicidal activity."
DB00432,Trifluridine,CHEMBL1129,"The mechanism of action of trifluridine has not been fully determined, but appears to involve the inhibition of viral replication. Trifluridine does this by incorporating into viral DNA during replication, which leads to the formation of defective proteins and an increased mutation rate. This drug also reversibly inhibits thymidylate synthetase, an enzyme that is necessary for DNA synthesis."
DB00433,Prochlorperazine,CHEMBL728,"The mechanism of action of prochlorperazine has not been fully determined, but may be primarily related to its antidopaminergic effects. Prochlorperazine blocks the D2 somatodendritic autoreceptor, resulting in the blockade of postsynaptic dopamine receptors in the mesolimbic system and an increased dopamine turnover. Prochlorperazine also has anti-emetic effects, which can be attributed to dopamine blockade in the chemoreceptor trigger zone. Prochlorperazine also blocks anticholinergic and alpha-adrenergic receptors, the blockade of alpha(1)-adrenergic receptors resulting in sedation, muscle relaxation, and hypotension."
DB00434,Cyproheptadine,CHEMBL516,"Cyproheptadine competes with free histamine for binding at HA-receptor sites. This antagonizes the effects of histamine on HA-receptors, leading to a reduction of the negative symptoms brought on by histamine HA-receptor binding. Cyproheptadine also competes with serotonin at receptor sites in smooth muscle in the intestines and other locations. Antagonism of serotonin on the appetite center of the hypothalamus may account for Cyproheptadine's ability to stimulate appetite."
DB00435,Nitric Oxide,CHEMBL1200689,"Nitric oxide is a compound produced by many cells of the body. It relaxes vascular smooth muscle by binding to the heme moiety of cytosolic guanylate cyclase, activating guanylate cyclase and increasing intracellular levels of cyclic guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate, which then leads to vasodilation. When inhaled, nitric oxide produces pulmonary vasodilation."
DB00436,Bendroflumethiazide,CHEMBL1684,"As a diuretic, bendroflumethiazide inhibits active chloride reabsorption at the early distal tubule via the Na-Cl cotransporter, resulting in an increase in the excretion of sodium, chloride, and water. Thiazides like bendroflumethiazide also inhibit sodium ion transport across the renal tubular epithelium through binding to the thiazide sensitive sodium-chloride transporter. This results in an increase in potassium excretion via the sodium-potassium exchange mechanism. The antihypertensive mechanism of bendroflumethiazide is less well understood although it may be mediated through its action on carbonic anhydrases in the smooth muscle or through its action on the large-conductance calcium-activated potassium (KCa) channel, also found in the smooth muscle."
DB00437,Allopurinol,CHEMBL1467,"Allopurinol and its active metabolite, oxypurinol, inhibits the enzyme xanthine oxidase, blocking the conversion of the oxypurines hypoxanthine and xanthine to uric acid. Elevated concentrations of oxypurine and oxypurine inhibition of xanthine oxidase through negative feedback results in a decrease in the concentrations of uric acid in the serum and urine. Allopurinol also facilitates the incorporation of hypoxanthine and xanthine into DNA and RNA, leading to a feedback inhibition of de novo purin synthesis and a decrease in serum uric acid concentrations as a result of an increase in nucleotide concentration."
DB00438,Ceftazidime,CHEMBL44354,The bactericidal activity of ceftazidime results from the inhibition of cell wall synthesis via affinity for penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs).
DB00439,Cerivastatin,CHEMBL1477,"Cerivastatin competitively inhibits hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, the hepatic enzyme responsible for converting HMG-CoA to mevalonate. As mevalonate is a precursor of sterols such as cholesterol, this results in a decrease in cholesterol in hepatic cells, upregulation of LDL-receptors, and an increase in hepatic uptake of LDL-cholesterol from the circulation."
DB00440,Trimethoprim,CHEMBL22,"Trimethoprim binds to dihydrofolate reductase and inhibits the reduction of dihydrofolic acid (DHF) to tetrahydrofolic acid (THF). THF is an essential precursor in the thymidine synthesis pathway and interference with this pathway inhibits bacterial DNA synthesis. Trimethoprim's affinity for bacterial dihydrofolate reductase is several thousand times greater than its affinity for human dihydrofolate reductase. Sulfamethoxazole inhibits dihydrofolate synthetase (aka dihydropteroate synthetase), an enzyme involved further upstream in the same pathway. Trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole are commonly used in combination due to their synergistic effects. This drug combination also reduces the development of resistance that is seen when either drug is used alone."
DB00441,Gemcitabine,CHEMBL888,"Gemcitabine inhibits thymidylate synthetase, leading to inhibition of DNA synthesis and cell death. Gemcitabine is a prodrug so activity occurs as a result of intracellular conversion to two active metabolites, gemcitabine diphosphate and gemcitabine triphosphate by deoxycitidine kinase. Gemcitabine diphosphate also inhibits ribonucleotide reductase, the enzyme responsible for catalyzing synthesis of deoxynucleoside triphosphates required for DNA synthesis. Finally, Gemcitabine triphosphate (diflurorodeoxycytidine triphosphate) competes with endogenous deoxynucleoside triphosphates for incorporation into DNA."
DB00442,Entecavir,CHEMBL713,"By competing with the natural substrate deoxyguanosine triphosphate, entecavir functionally inhibits all three activities of the HBV polymerase (reverse transcriptase, rt): (1) base priming, (2) reverse transcription of the negative strand from the pregenomic messenger RNA, and (3) synthesis of the positive strand of HBV DNA. Upon activation by kinases, the drug can be incorporated into the DNA which has the ultimate effect of inhibiting the HBV polymerase activity."
DB00443,Betamethasone,CHEMBL632,"Betamethasone is a glucocorticoid receptor agonist. This leads to changes in genetic expression once this complex binds to the GRE. The antiinflammatory actions of corticosteroids are thought to involve lipocortins, phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins which, through inhibition arachidonic acid, control the biosynthesis of prostaglandins and leukotrienes. The immune system is suppressed by corticosteroids due to a decrease in the function of the lymphatic system, a reduction in immunoglobulin and complement concentrations, the precipitation of lymphocytopenia, and interference with antigen-antibody binding. Betamethasone binds to plasma transcortin, and it becomes active when it is not bound to transcortin."
DB00444,Teniposide,CHEMBL452231,"The mechanism of action appears to be related to the inhibition of type II topoisomerase activity since teniposide does not intercalate into DNA or bind strongly to DNA. Teniposide binds to and inhibits DNA topoisomerase II. The cytotoxic effects of teniposide are related to the relative number of double-stranded DNA breaks produced in cells, which are a reflection of the stabilization of a topoisomerase II-DNA intermediate."
DB00445,Epirubicin,CHEMBL417,"Epirubicin has antimitotic and cytotoxic activity. It inhibits nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) and protein synthesis through a number of proposed mechanisms of action: Epirubicin forms complexes with DNA by intercalation between base pairs, and it inhibits topoisomerase II activity by stabilizing the DNA-topoisomerase II complex, preventing the religation portion of the ligation-religation reaction that topoisomerase II catalyzes. It also interferes with DNA replication and transcription by inhibiting DNA helicase activity."
DB00446,Chloramphenicol,CHEMBL130,"Chloramphenicol is lipid-soluble, allowing it to diffuse through the bacterial cell membrane. It then reversibly binds to the L16 protein of the 50S subunit of bacterial ribosomes, where transfer of amino acids to growing peptide chains is prevented (perhaps by suppression of peptidyl transferase activity), thus inhibiting peptide bond formation and subsequent protein synthesis."
DB00447,Loracarbef,CHEMBL1013,"Loracarbef is an oral, synthetic beta-lactam antibiotic of the carbacephem class. Chemically, carbacephems differ from cephalosporin-class antibiotics in the dihydrothiazine ring where a methylene group has been substituted for a sulfur atom. Loracarbef has a spectrum of activity similar to that of the second generation cephalosporins. It is structurally identical to cefaclor except for a sulfur atom that has been replaced by a methylene group. This change gives greater chemical stability in solution and allows storage at room temperature. Loracarbef, like all b-lactams and cephalosporins, inhibits penicillin binding proteins, enzymes that create the cross-linkage of the peptidoglycan polymer. This binding leads to interference with the formation and remodeling of the cell wall structure."
DB00448,Lansoprazole,CHEMBL480,"Lansoprazole belongs to a class of antisecretory compounds, the substituted benzimidazoles, that do not exhibit anticholinergic or histamine H<sub>2</sub>-receptor antagonist properties, but rather suppress gastric acid secretion by specific inhibition of the (H<sup>+</sup>,K<sup>+</sup>)-ATPase enzyme system at the secretory surface of the gastric parietal cell. Because this enzyme system is regarded as the acid (proton) pump within the parietal cell, Lansoprazole has been characterized as a gastric acid-pump inhibitor, in that it blocks the final step of acid production. This effect is dose-related and leads to inhibition of both basal and stimulated gastric acid secretion irrespective of the stimulus."
DB00449,Dipivefrin,CHEMBL1201262,"Dipivefrin is a prodrug with little or no pharmacologically activity until it is hydrolyzed into epinephrine inside the human eye. The liberated epinephrine, an adrenergic agonist, appears to exert its action by stimulating α -and/or β<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptors, leading to a decrease in aqueous production and an enhancement of outflow facility. The dipivefrin prodrug delivery system is a more efficient way of delivering the therapeutic effects of epinephrine, with fewer side effects than are associated with conventional epinephrine therapy."
DB00450,Droperidol,CHEMBL1108,"The exact mechanism of action is unknown, however, droperidol causes a CNS depression at subcortical levels of the brain, midbrain, and brainstem reticular formation. It may antagonize the actions of glutamic acid within the extrapyramidal system. It may also inhibit cathecolamine receptors and the reuptake of neurotransmiters and has strong central antidopaminergic action and weak central anticholinergic action. It can also produce ganglionic blockade and reduced affective response. The main actions seem to stem from its potent Dopamine(2) receptor antagonism with minor antagonistic effects on alpha-1 adrenergic receptors as well."
DB00451,Levothyroxine,CHEMBL1624,"Levothyroxine acts like the endogenous thyroid hormone thyroxine (T<sub>4</sub>, a tetra-iodinated tyrosine derivative). In the liver and kidney, T<sub>4</sub> is converted to T<sub>3</sub>, the active metabolite. In order to increase solubility, the thyroid hormones attach to thyroid hormone binding proteins, thyroxin-binding globulin, and thyroxin-binding prealbumin (transthyretin). Transport and binding to thyroid hormone receptors in the cytoplasm and nucleus then takes place. Thus by acting as a replacement for natural thyroxine, symptoms of thyroxine deficiency are relieved."
DB00452,Framycetin,CHEMBL184618,"Framycetin binds to specific 30S-subunit proteins and 16S rRNA, four nucleotides of 16S rRNA and a single amino acid of protein S12. This interferes with decoding site in the vicinity of nucleotide 1400 in 16S rRNA of 30S subunit. This region interacts with the wobble base in the anticodon of tRNA. This leads to interference with the initiation complex, misreading of mRNA so incorrect amino acids are inserted into the polypeptide leading to nonfunctional or toxic peptides and the breakup of polysomes into nonfunctional monosomes."
DB00453,Clomocycline,CHEMBL2106071,Clomocycline inhibits cell growth by inhibiting translation. It binds to the 30S ribosomal subunit and prevents the amino-acyl tRNA from binding to the A site of the ribosome. The binding is reversible in nature. Clomocycline is lipophilic and can easily pass through the cell membrane or passively diffuses through porin channels in the bacterial membrane.
DB00454,Pethidine,CHEMBL607,"Meperidine is primarily a kappa-opiate receptor agonist and also has local anesthetic effects. Meperidine has more affinity for the kappa-receptor than morphine. Opiate receptors are coupled with G-protein receptors and function as both positive and negative regulators of synaptic transmission via G-proteins that activate effector proteins. Binding of the opiate stimulates the exchange of GTP for GDP on the G-protein complex. As the effector system is adenylate cyclase and cAMP located at the inner surface of the plasma membrane, opioids decrease intracellular cAMP by inhibiting adenylate cyclase. Subsequently, the release of nociceptive neurotransmitters such as substance P, GABA, dopamine, acetylcholine and noradrenaline is inhibited. Opioids also inhibit the release of vasopressin, somatostatin, insulin and glucagon. Opioids close N-type voltage-operated calcium channels (OP2-receptor agonist) and open calcium-dependent inwardly rectifying potassium channels (OP3 and OP1 receptor agonist). This results in hyperpolarization and reduced neuronal excitability."
DB00455,Loratadine,CHEMBL998,"Loratadine competes with free histamine and exhibits specific, selective peripheral H<sub>1</sub> antagonistic activity. This blocks the action of endogenous histamine, which subsequently leads to temporary relief of the negative symptoms (eg. nasal congestion, watery eyes) brought on by histamine. Loratadine has low affinity for cholinergic receptors and does not exhibit any appreciable alpha-adrenergic blocking activity in-vitro. Loratadine also appears to suppress the release of histamine and leukotrienes from animal mast cells, and the release of leukotrienes from human lung fragments, although the clinical importance of this is unknown."
DB00456,Cefalotin,CHEMBL617,"The bactericidal activity of cefalotin results from the inhibition of cell wall synthesis via affinity for penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs). The PBPs are transpeptidases which are vital in peptidoglycan biosynthesis. Therefore, their inhibition prevents this vital cell wall compenent from being properly synthesized."
DB00457,Prazosin,CHEMBL2,"Prazosin acts by inhibiting the postsynaptic alpha(1)-adrenoceptors on vascular smooth muscle. This inhibits the vasoconstrictor effect of circulating and locally released catecholamines (epinephrine and norepinephrine), resulting in peripheral vasodilation."
DB00458,Imipramine,CHEMBL11,"Imipramine works by inhibiting the neuronal reuptake of the neurotransmitters norepinephrine and serotonin. It binds the sodium-dependent serotonin transporter and sodium-dependent norepinephrine transporter preventing or reducing the reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin by nerve cells. Depression has been linked to a lack of stimulation of the post-synaptic neuron by norepinephrine and serotonin. Slowing the reuptake of these neurotransmitters increases their concentration in the synaptic cleft, which is thought to contribute to relieving symptoms of depression. In addition to acutely inhibiting neurotransmitter re-uptake, imipramine causes down-regulation of cerebral cortical beta-adrenergic receptors and sensitization of post-synaptic serotonergic receptors with chronic use. This leads to enhanced serotonergic transmission. "
DB00459,Acitretin,CHEMBL1131,"The mechanism of action of acitretin is unknown, however it is believed to work by targeting specific receptors (retinoid receptors such as RXR and RAR) in the skin which help normalize the growth cycle of skin cells."
DB00460,Verteporfin,CHEMBL2052016,"Verteporfin is transported in the plasma primarily by lipoproteins. Once verteporfin is activated by light in the presence of oxygen, highly reactive, short-lived singlet oxygen and reactive oxygen radicals are generated. Light activation of verteporfin results in local damage to neovascular endothelium, resulting in vessel occlusion. Damaged endothelium is known to release procoagulant and vasoactive factors through the lipo-oxygenase (leukotriene) and cyclo-oxygenase (eicosanoids such as thromboxane) pathways, resulting in platelet aggregation, fibrin clot formation and vasoconstriction. Verteporfin appears to somewhat preferentially accumulate in neovasculature, including choroidal neovasculature. However, animal models indicate that the drug is also present in the retina. As singlet oxygen and reactive oxygen radicals are cytotoxic, Verteporfin can also be used to destroy tumor cells."
DB00461,Nabumetone,CHEMBL1070,"The parent compound is a prodrug, which undergoes hepatic biotransformation to the active component, 6-methoxy-2-naphthylacetic acid (6MNA), that is a potent inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis, most likely through binding to the COX-2 and COX-1 receptors."
DB00462,Methylscopolamine bromide,,Methscopolamine acts by interfering with the transmission of nerve impulses by acetylcholine in the parasympathetic nervous system (specifically the vomiting center). It does so by acting as a muscarinic antagonist.
DB00463,Metharbital,CHEMBL450,"Metharbital binds at a distinct binding site associated with a Cl<sup>-</sup> ionopore at the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor, increasing the duration of time for which the Cl<sup>-</sup> ionopore is open. The post-synaptic inhibitory effect of GABA in the thalamus is, therefore, prolonged. All of these effects are associated with marked decreases in GABA-sensitive neuronal calcium conductance (gCa). The net result of barbiturate action is acute potentiation of inhibitory GABAergic tone. Barbiturates also act through potent (if less well characterized) and direct inhibition of excitatory AMPA-type glutamate receptors, resulting in a profound suppression of glutamatergic neurotransmission."
DB00464,Sodium Tetradecyl Sulfate,CHEMBL1200354,"Sodium tetradecyl sulfate is a potent toxin for endothelial cells in that brief exposure to even low concentrations are effective in stripping endothelium over a considerable distance and exposing highly thrombogenic endothelium in the process. Diluted sodium tetradecyl sulfate is also able to induce a hypercoagulable state, possibly by selective inhibition of protein C, and can also promote platelet aggregation."
DB00465,Ketorolac,CHEMBL469,"Ketorolac is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) chemically related to indomethacin and tolmetin. Ketorolac tromethamine is a racemic mixture of [-]S- and [+]R-enantiomeric forms, with the S-form having analgesic activity. Its antiinflammatory effects are believed to be due to inhibition of both cylooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and cylooxygenase-2 (COX-2) which leads to the inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis leading to decreased formation of precursors of prostaglandins and thromboxanes from arachidonic acid. The resultant reduction in prostaglandin synthesis and activity may be at least partially responsible for many of the adverse, as well as the therapeutic, effects of these medications. Analgesia is probably produced via a peripheral action in which blockade of pain impulse generation results from decreased prostaglandin activity. However, inhibition of the synthesis or actions of other substances that sensitize pain receptors to mechanical or chemical stimulation may also contribute to the analgesic effect. In terms of the ophthalmic applications of ketorolac - ocular administration of ketorolac reduces prostaglandin E2 levels in aqueous humor, secondary to inhibition of prostaglandin biosynthesis."
DB00466,Picrotoxin,CHEMBL1908342,"Picrotoxin antagonizes the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor channel directly, which is a ligand-gated ion channel concerned chiefly with the passing of chloride ions across the cell membrane. Therefore picrotoxin prevents Cl<sup>-</sup> channel permeability and thus promtes an inhibitory influence on the target neuron. Picrotoxin reduces conductance through the channel by reducing not only the opening frequency but also the mean open time. Picrotoxin also antagonizes GABA<sub>C</sub> receptors (also called GABA<sub>A</sub>-rho receptors) but the result of this action is not known. The GABA<sub>C</sub> receptor is also linked to chloride channels, with distinct physiological and pharmacological properties. In contrast to the fast and transient responses elicited from GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors, GABA<sub>C</sub> receptors mediate slow and sustained responses."
DB00467,Enoxacin,CHEMBL826,Enoxacin exerts its bactericidal action via the inhibition of the essential bacterial enzyme DNA gyrase (DNA Topoisomerase II).
DB00468,Quinine,CHEMBL170,"The theorized mechanism of action for quinine and related anti-malarial drugs is that these drugs are toxic to the malaria parasite. Specifically, the drugs interfere with the parasite's ability to break down and digest hemoglobin. Consequently, the parasite starves and/or builds up toxic levels of partially degraded hemoglobin in itself. "
DB00469,Tenoxicam,CHEMBL302795,"The antiinflammatory effects of tenoxicam may result from the inhibition of the enzyme cycooxygenase and the subsequent peripheral inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis. As prostaglandins sensitize pain receptors, their inhibition accounts for the peripheral analgesic effects of tenoxicam. Antipyresis may occur by central action on the hypothalamus, resulting in peripheral dilation, increased cutaneous blood flow, and subsequent heat loss."
DB00470,Dronabinol,CHEMBL465,The mechanism of action of marinol is not completely understood. It is thought that cannabinoid receptors in neural tissues may mediate the effects of dronabinol and other cannabinoids. Animal studies with other cannabinoids suggest that marinol's antiemetic effects may be due to inhibition of the vomiting control mechanism in the medulla oblongata.
DB00471,Montelukast,CHEMBL787,"Montelukast selectively antagonizes leukotriene D<sub>4</sub> (LTD<sub>4</sub>) at the cysteinyl leukotriene receptor, CysLT<sub>1</sub>, in the human airway. Montelukast inhibits the actions of LTD<sub>4</sub> at the CysLT<sub>1</sub> receptor, preventing airway edema, smooth muscle contraction, and enhanced secretion of thick, viscous mucus."
DB00472,Fluoxetine,CHEMBL41,"Metabolized to norfluoxetine, fluoxetine is a selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), it blocks the reuptake of serotonin at the serotonin reuptake pump of the neuronal membrane, enhancing the actions of serotonin on 5HT<sub>1A</sub> autoreceptors. SSRIs bind with significantly less affinity to histamine, acetylcholine, and norepinephrine receptors than tricyclic antidepressant drugs."
DB00473,Hexylcaine,CHEMBL1197,"Hexyl caine acts mainly by inhibiting sodium influx through voltage gated sodium channels in the neuronal cell membrane of peripheral nerves. When the influx of sodium is interrupted, an action potential cannot arise and signal conduction is thus inhibited. The receptor site is thought to be located at the cytoplasmic (inner) portion of the sodium channel."
DB00474,Methohexital,CHEMBL7413,"Methohexital binds at a distinct binding site associated with a Cl<sup>-</sup> ionopore at the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor, increasing the duration of time for which the Cl<sup>-</sup> ionopore is open. The post-synaptic inhibitory effect of GABA in the thalamus is, therefore, prolonged."
DB00475,Chlordiazepoxide,CHEMBL451,"Chlordiazepoxide binds to stereospecific benzodiazepine (BZD) binding sites on GABA (A) receptor complexes at several sites within the central nervous system, including the limbic system and reticular formation. This results in an increased binding of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA to the GABA(A) receptor.BZDs, therefore, enhance GABA-mediated chloride influx through GABA receptor channels, causing membrane hyperpolarization. The net neuro-inhibitory effects result in the observed sedative, hypnotic, anxiolytic, and muscle relaxant properties."
DB00476,Duloxetine,CHEMBL1175,"Duloxetine is a potent inhibitor of neuronal serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake and a less potent inhibitor of dopamine reuptake. Duloxetine has no significant affinity for dopaminergic, adrenergic, cholinergic, histaminergic, opioid, glutamate, and GABA receptors. The antidepressant and pain inhibitory actions of duloxetine are believed to be related to its potentiation of serotonergic and noradrenergic activity in the CNS. The mechanism of action of duloxetine in SUI has not been determined, but is thought to be associated with the potentiation of serotonin and norepinephrine activity in the spinal cord, which increases urethral closure forces and thereby reduces involuntary urine loss."
DB00477,Chlorpromazine,CHEMBL71,"Chlorpromazine acts as an antagonist (blocking agent) on different postsysnaptic receptors -on dopaminergic-receptors (subtypes D1, D2, D3 and D4 - different antipsychotic properties on productive and unproductive symptoms), on serotonergic-receptors (5-HT1 and 5-HT2, with anxiolytic, antidepressive and antiaggressive properties as well as an attenuation of extrapypramidal side-effects, but also leading to weight gain, fall in blood pressure, sedation and ejaculation difficulties), on histaminergic-receptors (H1-receptors, sedation, antiemesis, vertigo, fall in blood pressure and weight gain), alpha1/alpha2-receptors (antisympathomimetic properties, lowering of blood pressure, reflex tachycardia, vertigo, sedation, hypersalivation and incontinence as well as sexual dysfunction, but may also attenuate pseudoparkinsonism - controversial) and finally on muscarinic (cholinergic) M1/M2-receptors (causing anticholinergic symptoms like dry mouth, blurred vision, obstipation, difficulty/inability to urinate, sinus tachycardia, ECG-changes and loss of memory, but the anticholinergic action may attenuate extrapyramidal side-effects).
Additionally, Chlorpromazine is a weak presynaptic inhibitor of Dopamine reuptake, which may lead to (mild) antidepressive and antiparkinsonian effects. This action could also account for psychomotor agitation and amplification of psychosis (very rarely noted in clinical use)."
DB00478,Rimantadine,CHEMBL959,"The mechanism of action of rimantadine is not fully understood. Rimantadine appears to exert its inhibitory effect early in the viral replicative cycle, possibly inhibiting the uncoating of the virus. Genetic studies suggest that a virus protein specified by the virion M2 gene plays an important role in the susceptibility of influenza A virus to inhibition by rimantadine."
DB00479,Amikacin,CHEMBL177,"Aminoglycosides like Amikacin ""irreversibly"" bind to specific 30S-subunit proteins and 16S rRNA. Amikacin inhibits protein synthesis by binding to the 30S ribosomal subunit to prevent the formation of an initiation complex with messenger RNA. Specifically Amikacin binds to four nucleotides of 16S rRNA and a single amino acid of protein S12. This interferes with decoding site in the vicinity of nucleotide 1400 in 16S rRNA of 30S subunit. This region interacts with the wobble base in the anticodon of tRNA. This leads to interference with the initiation complex, misreading of mRNA so incorrect amino acids are inserted into the polypeptide leading to nonfunctional or toxic peptides and the breakup of polysomes into nonfunctional monosomes."
DB00480,Lenalidomide,CHEMBL848,"The mechanism of action of lenalidomide remains to be fully characterized, however it has been demonstrated that lenalidomide inhibits the expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), but not COX-1, in vitro. In vivo it induces tumor cell apoptosis directly and indirectly by inhibition of bone marrow stromal cell support, by anti-angiogenic and anti-osteoclastogenic effects, and by immunomodulatory activity"
DB00481,Raloxifene,CHEMBL81,"Raloxifene binds to estrogen receptors, resulting in differential expression of multiple estrogen-regulated genes in different tissues. Raloxifene produces estrogen-like effects on bone, reducing resorption of bone and increasing bone mineral density in postmenopausal women, thus slowing the rate of bone loss. The maintenance of bone mass by raloxifene and estrogens is, in part, through the regulation of the gene-encoding transforming growth factor-β3 (TGF-β3), which is a bone matrix protein with antiosteoclastic properties. Raloxifene activates TGF-β3 through pathways that are estrogen receptor-mediated but involve DNA sequences distinct from the estrogen response element. The drug also binds to the estrogen receptor and acts as an estrogen agonist in preosteoclastic cells, which results in the inhibtion of their proliferative capacity. This inhibition is thought to contribute to the drug's effect on bone resorption. Other mechanisms include the suppression of activity of the bone-resorbing cytokine interleukin-6 promoter activity. Raloxifene also antagonizes the effects of estrogen on mammary tissue and blocks uterotrophic responses to estrogen. By competing with estrogens for the estrogen receptors in reproductive tissue, raloxifene prevents the transcriptional activation of genes containing the estrogen response element. As well, raloxifene inhibits the estradiol-dependent proliferation of MCF-7 human mammary tumor cells in vitro. The mechansim of action of raloxifene has not been fully determined, but evidence suggests that the drug's tissue-specific estrogen agonist or antagonist activity is related to the structural differences between the raloxifene-estrogen receptor complex (specifically the surface topography of AF-2) and the estrogen-estrogen receptor complex. Also, the existence of at least 2 estrogen receptors (ERα, ERβ) may contribute to the tissue specificity of raloxifene. "
DB00482,Celecoxib,CHEMBL118,"The mechanism of action of celecoxib is believed to be due to inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis. Unlike most NSAIDs, which inhibit both types of cyclooxygenases (COX-1 and COX-2), celecoxib is a selective noncompetitive inhibitor of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) enzyme. It binds with its polar sulfonamide side chain to a hydrophilic side pocket region close to the active COX-2 binding site. Both COX-1 and COX-2 catalyze the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandin (PG) H2, the precursor of PGs and thromboxane."
DB00483,Gallamine Triethiodide,CHEMBL1200993,It competes with acetylcholine (ACh) molecules and binds to muscarinic acetylcholine receptors on the post-synaptic membrane of the motor endplate. It acts by combining with the cholinergic receptor sites in muscle and competitively blocking the transmitter action of acetylcholine. It blocks the action of ACh and prevents activation of the muscle contraction process. It can also act on nicotinic presynaptic acetylcholine receptors which inhibits the release of ACh.
DB00484,Brimonidine,CHEMBL844,Brimonidine is an alpha adrenergic receptor agonist (primarily alpha-2). It has a peak ocular hypotensive effect occurring at two hours post-dosing. Fluorophotometric studies in animals and humans suggest that Brimonidine has a dual mechanism of action by reducing aqueous humor production and increasing uveoscleral outflow. The topical gel reduces erythema through direct vasocontriction. 
DB00485,Dicloxacillin,CHEMBL893,"Dicloxacillin exerts a bactericidal action against penicillin-susceptible microorganisms during the state of active multiplication. All penicillins inhibit the biosynthesis of the bacterial cell wall. By binding to specific penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) located inside the bacterial cell wall, dicloxacillin inhibits the third and last stage of bacterial cell wall synthesis. Cell lysis is then mediated by bacterial cell wall autolytic enzymes such as autolysins; it is possible that dicloxacillin interferes with an autolysin inhibitor."
DB00486,Nabilone,CHEMBL947,"The mode of action of nabilone has been studied in cats and dogs. Although its anti-emetic action is not yet fully understood, it is apparent that there are a number of points in the control systems of the body at which Nabilone could block the emetic mechanism. It is likely that nabilone exerts its actions via binding to the cannabinoid receptors."
DB00487,Pefloxacin,CHEMBL267648,"The bactericidal action of pefloxacin results from interference with the activity of the bacterial enzymes DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV, which are needed for the transcription and replication of bacterial DNA. DNA gyrase appears to be the primary quinolone target for gram-negative bacteria. Topoisomerase IV appears to be the preferential target in gram-positive organisms. Interference with these two topoisomerases results in strand breakage of the bacterial chromosome, supercoiling, and resealing. As a result DNA replication and transcription is inhibited."
DB00488,Altretamine,CHEMBL1455,"The precise mechanism by which altretamine exerts its cytotoxic effect is unknown although it is classified as an alkylating anti-neoplastic agent. Through this mechanism, the drug is metabolized into alkylating agents by N-demethylation. These alkylating species consequently damage tumor cells."
DB00489,Sotalol,CHEMBL471,"Sotalol has both beta-adrenoreceptor blocking (Vaughan Williams Class I) and cardiac action potential duration prolongation (Vaughan Williams Class I) antiarrhythmic properties. Sotalol is a racemic mixture of d- and l-sotalol. Both isomers have similar Class I antiarrhythmic effects, while the l-isomer is responsible for virtually all of the beta-blocking activity. Sotalol inhibits response to adrenergic stimuli by competitively blocking β<sub>1</sub>-adrenergic receptors within the myocardium and β<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptors within bronchial and vascular smooth muscle. The electrophysiologic effects of sotalol may be due to its selective inhibition of the rapidly activating component of the potassium channel involved in the repolarization of cardiac cells. The class II electrophysiologic effects are caused by an increase in sinus cycle length (slowed heart rate), decreased AV nodal conduction, and increased AV nodal refractoriness, while the class III electrophysiological effects include prolongation of the atrial and ventricular monophasic action potentials, and effective refractory period prolongation of atrial muscle, ventricular muscle, and atrio-ventricular accessory pathways (where present) in both the anterograde and retrograde directions. "
DB00490,Buspirone,CHEMBL49,"Buspirone binds to 5-HT type 1A serotonin receptors on presynaptic neurons in the dorsal raphe and on postsynaptic neurons in the hippocampus, thus inhibiting the firing rate of 5-HT-containing neurons in the dorsal raphe. Buspirone also binds at dopamine type 2 (DA2) receptors, blocking presynaptic dopamine receptors. Buspirone increases firing in the locus ceruleus, an area of brain where norepinephrine cell bodies are found in high concentration. The net result of buspirone actions is that serotonergic activity is suppressed while noradrenergic and dopaminergic cell firing is enhanced."
DB00491,Miglitol,CHEMBL1561,"In contrast to sulfonylureas, miglitol does not enhance insulin secretion. The antihyperglycemic action of miglitol results from a reversible inhibition of membrane-bound intestinal a-glucoside hydrolase enzymes. Membrane-bound intestinal a-glucosidases hydrolyze oligosaccharides and disaccharides to glucose and other monosaccharides in the brush border of the small intestine. In diabetic patients, this enzyme inhibition results in delayed glucose absorption and lowering of postprandial hyperglycemia."
DB00492,Fosinopril,CHEMBL3306578,"There are two isoforms of ACE: the somatic isoform, which exists as a glycoprotein comprised of a single polypeptide chain of 1277; and the testicular isoform, which has a lower molecular mass and is thought to play a role in sperm maturation and binding of sperm to the oviduct epithelium. Somatic ACE has two functionally active domains, N and C, which arise from tandem gene duplication. Although the two domains have high sequence similarity, they play distinct physiological roles. The C-domain is predominantly involved in blood pressure regulation while the N-domain plays a role in hematopoietic stem cell differentiation and proliferation. ACE inhibitors bind to and inhibit the activity of both domains, but have much greater affinity for and inhibitory activity against the C-domain. Fosinoprilat, the active metabolite of fosinopril, competes with ATI for binding to ACE and inhibits and enzymatic proteolysis of ATI to ATII. Decreasing ATII levels in the body decreases blood pressure by inhibiting the pressor effects of ATII as described in the Pharmacology section above. Fosinoprilat also causes an increase in plasma renin activity likely due to a loss of feedback inhibition mediated by ATII on the release of renin and/or stimulation of reflex mechanisms via baroreceptors. "
DB00493,Cefotaxime,CHEMBL1730,The bactericidal activity of cefotaxime results from the inhibition of cell wall synthesis via affinity for penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs). Cefotaxime shows high affinity for penicillin-binding proteins in the cell wall including PBP Ib and PBP III.
DB00494,Entacapone,CHEMBL953,"The mechanism of action of entacapone is believed to be through its ability to inhibit COMT in peripheral tissues, altering the plasma pharmacokinetics of levodopa. When entacapone is given in conjunction with levodopa and an aromatic amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor, such as carbidopa, plasma levels of levodopa are greater and more sustained than after administration of levodopa and an aromatic amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor alone. It is believed that at a given frequency of levodopa administration, these more sustained plasma levels of levodopa result in more constant dopaminergic stimulation in the brain, leading to a greater reduction in the manifestations of parkinsonian syndrome."
DB00495,Zidovudine,CHEMBL129,"Zidovudine, a structural analog of thymidine, is a prodrug that must be phosphorylated to its active 5′-triphosphate metabolite, zidovudine triphosphate (ZDV-TP). It inhibits the activity of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) via DNA chain termination after incorporation of the nucleotide analogue. It competes with the natural substrate dGTP and incorporates itself into viral DNA. It is also a weak inhibitor of cellular DNA polymerase α and γ.  "
DB00496,Darifenacin,CHEMBL1346,"Darifenacin selectively antagonizes the muscarinic M3 receptor. M3 receptors are involved in contraction of human bladder and gastrointestinal smooth muscle, saliva production, and iris sphincter function."
DB00497,Oxycodone,CHEMBL656,"Oxycodone acts as a weak agonist at mu, kappa, and delta opioid receptors within the central nervous system (CNS). Oxycodone primarily affects mu-type opioid receptors, which are coupled with G-protein receptors and function as modulators, both positive and negative, of synaptic transmission via G-proteins that activate effector proteins. Binding of the opiate stimulates the exchange of GTP for GDP on the G-protein complex. As the effector system is adenylate cyclase and cAMP located at the inner surface of the plasma membrane, opioids decrease intracellular cAMP by inhibiting adenylate cyclase. Subsequently, the release of nociceptive neurotransmitters such as substance P, GABA, dopamine, acetylcholine, and noradrenaline is inhibited. Opioids such as oxycodone also inhibit the release of vasopressin, somatostatin, insulin, and glucagon. Opioids close N-type voltage-operated calcium channels (kappa-receptor agonist) and open calcium-dependent inwardly rectifying potassium channels (mu and delta receptor agonist). This results in hyperpolarization and reduced neuronal excitability."
DB00498,Phenindione,CHEMBL711,"Phenindione inhibits vitamin K reductase, resulting in depletion of the reduced form of vitamin K (vitamin KH2). As vitamin K is a cofactor for the carboxylation of glutamate residues on the N-terminal regions of vitamin K-dependent proteins, this limits the gamma-carboxylation and subsequent activation of the vitamin K-dependent coagulant proteins. The synthesis of vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors II, VII, IX, and X and anticoagulant proteins C and S is inhibited. Depression of three of the four vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors (factors II, VII, and X) results in decreased prothrombin levels and a decrease in the amount of thrombin generated and bound to fibrin. This reduces the thrombogenicity of clots."
DB00499,Flutamide,CHEMBL806,"Flutamide is a nonsteroidal antiandrogen that blocks the action of both endogenous and exogenous testosterone by binding to the androgen receptor. In addition Flutamide is a potent inhibitor of testosterone-stimulated prostatic DNA synthesis. Moreover, it is capable of inhibiting prostatic nuclear uptake of androgen."
DB00500,Tolmetin,CHEMBL1020,"The mode of action of tolmetin is not known. However, studies in laboratory animals and man have demonstrated that the anti-inflammatory action of tolmetin is not due to pituitary-adrenal stimulation. Tolmetin inhibits prostaglandin synthetase in vitro and lowers the plasma level of prostaglandin E in man. This reduction in prostaglandin synthesis may be responsible for the anti-inflammatory action. Tolmetin does not appear to alter the course of the underlying disease in man."
DB00501,Cimetidine,CHEMBL30,"Cimetidine binds to an H<sub>2</sub>-receptor located on the basolateral membrane of the gastric parietal cell, blocking histamine effects. This competitive inhibition results in reduced gastric acid secretion and a reduction in gastric volume and acidity."
DB00502,Haloperidol,CHEMBL54,"The precise mechanism whereby the therapeutic effects of haloperidol are produced is not known, but the drug appears to depress the CNS at the subcortical level of the brain, midbrain, and brain stem reticular formation. Haloperidol seems to inhibit the ascending reticular activating system of the brain stem (possibly through the caudate nucleus), thereby interrupting the impulse between the diencephalon and the cortex. The drug may antagonize the actions of glutamic acid within the extrapyramidal system, and inhibitions of catecholamine receptors may also contribute to haloperidol's mechanism of action. Haloperidol may also inhibit the reuptake of various neurotransmitters in the midbrain, and appears to have a strong central antidopaminergic and weak central anticholinergic activity. The drug produces catalepsy and inhibits spontaneous motor activity and conditioned avoidance behaviours in animals. The exact mechanism of antiemetic action of haloperidol has also not been fully determined, but the drug has been shown to directly affect the chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ) through the blocking of dopamine receptors in the CTZ."
DB00503,Ritonavir,CHEMBL163,"Ritonavic inhibits the HIV viral proteinase enzyme that normally cleaves the structural and replicative proteins that arise from major HIV genes, such as *gag* and *pol*. *Gag* encodes proteins involved in the core and the nucleocapsid, while *pol* encodes the the HIV reverse transcriptase, ribonuclease H, integrase, and protease [A19647]. The *pol*-encoded proteins are initially translated in the form of a larger precursoe polypeptide, *gag-pol*, and needs to be cleaved by HIV protease to form other complement proteins [A19647]. Ritonavir prevents the cleavage of the *gag-pol* polyprotein, which results in noninfectious, immature viral particles. Ritonavir is a potent inhibitor of cytochrome P450 CYP3A4 isoenzyme present both in the intestinal tract and liver [A19647]. It is a type II ligand that perfectly fits into the CYP3A4 active site cavity and irreversibly binds to the heme iron via the thiazole nitrogen, which decreases the redox potential of the protein and precludes its reduction with the redox partner, cytochrome P450 reductase [A19648]. Ritonavir may also play a role in limiting cellular transport and efflux of other protease inhibitors via the P-glycoprotein and MRP efflux channels [A19647]."
DB00504,Levallorphan,CHEMBL1254682,Levallorphan antagonizes opioid effects by competing for the same receptor sites. It binds to the opioid mu receptor and the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor alpha2/alpha3.
DB00505,Tridihexethyl,CHEMBL1201354,"Tridihexethyl binds the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor. It may block all three types of muscarinic receptors including M-1 receptors in the CNS and ganglia, M-2 receptors in the heart (vagus) and M-3 receptors at the parasympathetic NEJ system. The muscarinic acetylcholine receptors mediate various cellular responses, including inhibition of adenylate cyclase, breakdown of phosphoinositides and modulation of potassium channels through the action of G proteins. Tridihexethyl inhibits vagally mediated reflexes by antagonizing the action of acetylcholine. This in turn reduces the secretion of gastric acids in the stomach."
DB00507,Nitazoxanide,CHEMBL1401,The antiprotozoal activity of nitazoxanide is believed to be due to interference with the pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase (PFOR) enzyme-dependent electron transfer reaction which is essential to anaerobic energy metabolism. Studies have shown that the PFOR enzyme from Giardia lamblia directly reduces nitazoxanide by transfer of electrons in the absence of ferredoxin. The DNA-derived PFOR protein sequence of Cryptosporidium parvum appears to be similar to that of Giardia lamblia. Interference with the PFOR enzyme-dependent electron transfer reaction may not be the only pathway by which nitazoxanide exhibits antiprotozoal activity.
DB00508,Triflupromazine,CHEMBL570,Triflupromazine binds to the dopamine D1 and dopamine D2 receptors and inhibits their activity. The mechanism of the anti-emetic effect is due predominantly to blockage of the dopamine D2 neurotransmitter receptors in the chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ) and vomiting centre. Triflupromazine blocks the neurotransmitter dopamine and the vagus nerve in the gastrointestinal tract. Triflupromazine also binds the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (M1 and M2) and the tryptamine D receptors (5HT<sub>2B</sub>).
DB00509,Dextrothyroxine,CHEMBL559,"Dextrothyroxine is a antihyperlipidemic. The mechanism of action is not completely understood, but dextrothyroxine apparently acts in the liver to stimulate formation of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and, to a much greater extent, to increase catabolism of LDL. This leads to increased excretion of cholesterol and bile acids via the biliary route into the feces, with a resulting reduction in serum cholesterol and LDL. Dextrothyroxine has no significant effect on high-density lipoproteins (HDL).
Inherently, it will also bind to thyroid receptors and as it is a prohormone, it will bind as a substrate to iodide peroxidase."
DB00511,Acetyldigitoxin,CHEMBL3545057,"Acetyldigitoxin binds to a site on the extracellular aspect of the &alpha;-subunit of the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> ATPase pump in the membranes of heart cells (myocytes). This causes an increase in the level of sodium ions in the myocytes, which then leads to a rise in the level of calcium ions. The proposed mechanism is the following: inhibition of the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> pump leads to increased Na<sup>+</sup> levels, which in turn slows down the extrusion of Ca<sup>2+</sup> via the Na<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup> exchange pump. Increased amounts of Ca<sup>2+</sup> are then stored in the sarcoplasmic reticulum and released by each action potential, which is unchanged by acetyldigitoxin. This is a different mechanism from that of catecholamines. Acetyldigitoxin also increases vagal activity via its central action on the central nervous system, thus decreasing the conduction of electrical impulses through the AV node. This is important for its clinical use in different arrhythmias."
DB00512,Vancomycin,CHEMBL262777,"The bactericidal action of vancomycin results primarily from inhibition of cell-wall biosynthesis. Specifically, vancomycin prevents incorporation of N-acetylmuramic acid (NAM)- and N-acetylglucosamine (NAG)-peptide subunits from being incorporated into the peptidoglycan matrix; which forms the major structural component of Gram-positive cell walls. The large hydrophilic molecule is able to form hydrogen bond interactions with the terminal D-alanyl-D-alanine moieties of the NAM/NAG-peptides. Normally this is a five-point interaction. This binding of vancomycin to the D-Ala-D-Ala prevents the incorporation of the NAM/NAG-peptide subunits into the peptidoglycan matrix. In addition, vancomycin alters bacterial-cell-membrane permeability and RNA synthesis. There is no cross-resistance between vancomycin and other antibiotics. Vancomycin is not active in vitro against gram-negative bacilli, mycobacteria, or fungi."
DB00513,Aminocaproic Acid,CHEMBL1046,"Aminocaproic acid binds reversibly to the kringle domain of plasminogen and blocks the binding of plasminogen to fibrin and its activation to plasmin. With NO activation of plasmin, there is a reduction in fibrinolysis. This consequently will reduce the amount of bleeding post surgery. Elevated plasma levels of lipoprotein(a) have been shown to increase the risk of vascular disease. Lipoprotein 9a)a has two components, apolipoprotein B-100, linked to apolipoprotein (a). Aminocaproic acid may change the conformation of apoliprotein (a), changing its binding properties and potentially preventing the formation of lipoprotein (a)."
DB00514,Dextromethorphan,CHEMBL52440,"Dextromethorphan is an opioid-like drug that binds to and acts as antagonist to the NMDA glutamatergic receptor, it is an agonist to the opioid sigma 1 and sigma 2 receptors, it is also an alpha3/beta4 nicotinic receptor antagonist and targets the serotonin reuptake pump. Dextromethorphan is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, where it enters the bloodstream and crosses the blood-brain barrier. The first-pass through the hepatic portal vein results in some of the drug being metabolized into an active metabolite of dextromethorphan, dextrorphan, the 3-hydroxy derivative of dextromethorphan."
DB00515,Cisplatin,CHEMBL2068237,"Alkylating agents work by three different mechanisms: 1) attachment of alkyl groups to DNA bases, resulting in the DNA being fragmented by repair enzymes in their attempts to replace the alkylated bases, preventing DNA synthesis and RNA transcription from the affected DNA, 2) DNA damage via the formation of cross-links (bonds between atoms in the DNA) which prevents DNA from being separated for synthesis or transcription, and 3) the induction of mispairing of the nucleotides leading to mutations."
DB00516,Bentoquatam,CHEMBL1201446,The mechanism of action is unknown. It is thought topically applied bentoquatam acts as a physical barrier that interferes with the adsorption of antigens onto the skin and reduces absorption of antigens into the skin. It probably does not work by modifying the systemic allergic response.
DB00517,Anisotropine Methylbromide,CHEMBL1578,"Quaternary ammonium compounds such as anisotropine methylbromide inhibit the muscarinic actions of acetylcholine on structures innervated by postganglionic cholinergic nerves as well as on smooth muscles that respond to acetylcholine but lack cholinergic innervation. These postganglionic receptor sites are present in the autonomic effector cells of the smooth muscle, cardiac muscle, sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes, and exocrine glands."
DB00518,Albendazole,CHEMBL1483,"Albendazole causes degenerative alterations in the tegument and intestinal cells of the worm by binding to the colchicine-sensitive site of tubulin, thus inhibiting its polymerization or assembly into microtubules. The loss of the cytoplasmic microtubules leads to impaired uptake of glucose by the larval and adult stages of the susceptible parasites, and depletes their glycogen stores. Degenerative changes in the endoplasmic reticulum, the mitochondria of the germinal layer, and the subsequent release of lysosomes result in decreased production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is the energy required for the survival of the helminth. Due to diminished energy production, the parasite is immobilized and eventually dies."
DB00519,Trandolapril,CHEMBL1519,"There are two isoforms of ACE: the somatic isoform, which exists as a glycoprotein comprised of a single polypeptide chain of 1277; and the testicular isoform, which has a lower molecular mass and is thought to play a role in sperm maturation and binding of sperm to the oviduct epithelium. Somatic ACE has two functionally active domains, N and C, which arise from tandem gene duplication. Although the two domains have high sequence similarity, they play distinct physiological roles. The C-domain is predominantly involved in blood pressure regulation while the N-domain plays a role in hematopoietic stem cell differentiation and proliferation. ACE inhibitors bind to and inhibit the activity of both domains, but have much greater affinity for and inhibitory activity against the C-domain. Trandolaprilat, the active metabolite of trandolapril, competes with ATI for binding to ACE and inhibits and enzymatic proteolysis of ATI to ATII. Decreasing ATII levels in the body decreases blood pressure by inhibiting the pressor effects of ATII as described in the Pharmacology section above. Trandolaprilat also causes an increase in plasma renin activity likely due to a loss of feedback inhibition mediated by ATII on the release of renin and/or stimulation of reflex mechanisms via baroreceptors. "
DB00520,Caspofungin,CHEMBL499808,"Caspofungin inhibits the synthesis of beta-(1,3)-D-glucan, an essential component of the cell wall of <i>Aspergillus</i> species and <i>Candida</i> species. beta-(1,3)-D-glucan is not present in mammalian cells. The primary target is beta-(1,3)-glucan synthase."
DB00521,Carteolol,CHEMBL839,The primary mechanism of the ocular hypotensive action of carteolol in reducing intraocular pressure is most likely a decrease in aqueous humor production. This process is initiated by the non-selective beta1 and beta2 adrenergic receptor blockade.
DB00522,Bentiromide,CHEMBL1200368,"Bentiromide is a peptide that is broken down in the pancreas by chymotrypsin. By determining the output of unchanged bentiromide in the urine following oral administration, it is possible to determine the sufficiency of pancreatic activity."
DB00523,Alitretinoin,CHEMBL705,"Alitretinoin binds to and activates all known intracellular retinoid receptor subtypes (RARa, RARb, RARg, RXRa, RXRb and RXRg). Once activated these receptors function as transcription factors that regulate the expression of genes that control the process of cellular differentiation and proliferation in both normal and neoplastic cells."
DB00524,Metolazone,CHEMBL878,The actions of metolazone result from interference with the renal tubular mechanism of electrolyte reabsorption. Metolazone acts primarily to inhibit sodium reabsorption at the cortical diluting site and to a lesser extent in the proximal convoluted tubule. Sodium and chloride ions are excreted in approximately equivalent amounts. The increased delivery of sodium to the distal tubular exchange site results in increased potassium excretion. Metolazone does not inhibit carbonic anhydrase. The antihypertensive mechanism of action of metolazone is not fully understood but is presumed to be related to its saluretic and diuretic properties.
DB00525,Tolnaftate,CHEMBL83668,"Tolnaftate is a topical fungicide. Though its exact mechanism unknown, it is believed to prevent ergosterol biosynthesis by inhibiting squalene epoxidase. It has also been reported to distort the hyphae and to stunt mycelial growth in susceptible organisms."
DB00526,Oxaliplatin,CHEMBL414804,"Oxaliplatin undergoes nonenzymatic conversion to active derivatives via displacement of the labile oxalate ligand. Several transient reactive species are formed, including monoaquo and diaquo DACH platinum, which covalently bind with macromolecules. After activation, oxaliplatin binds preferentially to the guanine and cytosine moieties of DNA, leading to cross-linking of DNA, thus inhibiting DNA synthesis and transcription. Cytotoxicity is cell-cycle nonspecific. "
DB00527,Cinchocaine,CHEMBL1086,"Local anesthetics block both the initiation and conduction of nerve impulses by decreasing the neuronal membrane's permeability to sodium ions through sodium channel inhibition. This reversibly stabilizes the membrane and inhibits depolarization, resulting in the failure of a propagated action potential and subsequent conduction blockade."
DB00528,Lercanidipine,CHEMBL250270,"By deforming the channel, inhibiting ion-control gating mechanisms, and/or interfering with the release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, Lercanidipine inhibits the influx of extracellular calcium across the myocardial and vascular smooth muscle cell membranes The decrease in intracellular calcium inhibits the contractile processes of the myocardial smooth muscle cells, causing dilation of the coronary and systemic arteries, increased oxygen delivery to the myocardial tissue, decreased total peripheral resistance, decreased systemic blood pressure, and decreased afterload."
DB00529,Foscarnet,CHEMBL666,Foscarnet exerts its antiviral activity by a selective inhibition at the pyrophosphate binding site on virus-specific DNA polymerases at concentrations that do not affect cellular DNA polymerases.
DB00530,Erlotinib,CHEMBL553,The mechanism of clinical antitumor action of erlotinib is not fully characterized. Erlotinib inhibits the intracellular phosphorylation of tyrosine kinase associated with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Specificity of inhibition with regard to other tyrosine kinase receptors has not been fully characterized. EGFR is expressed on the cell surface of normal cells and cancer cells.
DB00531,Cyclophosphamide,CHEMBL88,"Alkylating agents work by three different mechanisms: 1) attachment of alkyl groups to DNA bases, resulting in the DNA being fragmented by repair enzymes in their attempts to replace the alkylated bases, preventing DNA synthesis and RNA transcription from the affected DNA, 2) DNA damage via the formation of cross-links (bonds between atoms in the DNA) which prevents DNA from being separated for synthesis or transcription, and 3) the induction of mispairing of the nucleotides leading to mutations."
DB00532,Mephenytoin,CHEMBL861,"The mechanism of action of mephenytoin is not definitely known, but extensive research strongly suggests that its main mechanism is to block frequency-, use- and voltage-dependent neuronal sodium channels, and therefore limit repetitive firing of action potentials."
DB00533,Rofecoxib,CHEMBL122,"The anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antipyretic effects of NSAIDs appear to result from the inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis. Although the exact mechanism of action has not been determined, these effects appear to be mediated through the inhibition of the COX-2 isoenzyme at the sites of inflammation with subsequent reduction in the synthesis of certain prostaglandins from their arachidonic acid precursors. Rofecoxib selectively inhibits the cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) enzyme, which is important for the mediation of inflammation and pain. Unlike non-selective NSAIDs, rofecoxib does not inhibit platelet aggregation. It also has little to no affinity for COX-1."
DB00534,Chlormerodrin,,"Chlormerodrin most likely acts by a direct renal action. Mercurial diuresis is presumed to occur through inhibition of reabsorption of water and electrolytes in the convoluted tubules, although the problem of whether the locus of action is primarily on the proximal or distal portion has not yet been settled. There is also evidence that mercurials interfere with the permeability of the membrane of tubular cells by increasing passive influx of Na<sup>+</sup> ion, Cl<sup>-</sup> ion and water into the cells, without interfering with the active extrusion of Na<sup>+</sup> ion. Lastly, there is some evidence that chlormerodrin inhibits succinic dehydrogenase, but the clinical significance of this binding is not known."
DB00535,Cefdinir,CHEMBL927,"As with other cephalosporins, bactericidal activity of cefdinir results from inhibition of cell wall synthesis by acting on penicillin binding proteins (PBPs)."
DB00536,Guanidine,CHEMBL821,
DB00537,Ciprofloxacin,CHEMBL8,"The bactericidal action of ciprofloxacin results from inhibition of the enzymes topoisomerase II (DNA gyrase) and topoisomerase IV, which are required for bacterial DNA replication, transcription, repair, strand supercoiling repair, and recombination."
DB00538,Gadoversetamide,CHEMBL1200457,"Based on the behavior of protons when placed in a strong magnetic field, which is interpreted and transformed into images by magnetic resonance (MR) instruments. MR images are based primarily on proton density and proton relaxation dynamics. MR instruments are sensitive to two different relaxation processes, the T1 (spin-lattice or longitudinal relaxation time) and T2 (spin-spin or transverse relaxation time). Paramagnetic agents contain one or more unpaired electrons that enhance the T1 and T2 relaxation rates of protons in their molecular environment. In MRI, visualization of normal and pathological brain, spinal and hepatic tissue depends in part on variations in the radio frequency signal intensity that occur with changes in proton density, alteration of the T1, and variation in T2. When placed in a magnetic field, gadoversetamide shortens the T1 and T2 relaxation times in tissues where it accumulates. At the recommended dose, the effect is primarily on T1 relaxation time, and produces an increase in signal intensity (brightness). Gadoversetamide does not cross the intact blood-brain barrier; therefore, it does not accumulate in normal brain tissue or in CNS lesions that may have a normal blood-brain barrier (e.g., cysts, mature post-operative scars). Abnormal vascularity or disruption of the blood-brain barrier allows accumulation of gadoversetamide in lesions such as neoplasms, abscesses, and subacute infarcts."
DB00539,Toremifene,CHEMBL1655,"Toremifene is a nonsteroidal triphenylethylene derivative. Toremifene binds to estrogen receptors and may exert estrogenic, antiestrogenic, or both activities, depending upon the duration of treatment, animal species, gender, target organ, or endpoint selected. The antitumor effect of toremifene in breast cancer is believed to be mainly due to its antiestrogenic effects, in other words, its ability to compete with estrogen for binding sites in the cancer, blocking the growth-stimulating effects of estrogen in the tumor. Toremifene may also inhibit tumor growth through other mechanisms, such as induction of apoptosis, regulation of oncogene expression, and growth factors."
DB00540,Nortriptyline,CHEMBL445,It is believed that nortriptyline either inhibits the reuptake of the neurotransmitter serotonin at the neuronal membrane or acts at beta-adrenergic receptors. Tricyclic antidepressants do not inhibit monoamine oxidase nor do they affect dopamine reuptake.
DB00541,Vincristine,CHEMBL90555,"The antitumor activity of Vincristine is thought to be due primarily to inhibition of mitosis at metaphase through its interaction with tubulin. Like other vinca alkaloids, Vincristine may also interfere with: 1) amino acid, cyclic AMP, and glutathione metabolism, 2) calmodulin-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup>-transport ATPase activity, 3) cellular respiration, and 4) nucleic acid and lipid biosynthesis."
DB00542,Benazepril,CHEMBL838,"Benazeprilat, the active metabolite of Benazepril, competes with angiotensin I for binding at the angiotensin-converting enzyme, blocking the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II. Inhibition of ACE results in decreased plasma angiotensin II. As angiotensin II is a vasoconstrictor and a negative-feedback mediator for renin activity, lower concentrations result in a decrease in blood pressure and stimulation of baroreceptor reflex mechanisms, which leads to decreased vasopressor activity and to decreased aldosterone secretion. Benazeprilat may also act on kininase II, an enzyme identical to ACE that degrades the vasodilator bradykinin."
DB00543,Amoxapine,CHEMBL1113,Amoxapine acts by decreasing the reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin (5-HT).
DB00544,Fluorouracil,CHEMBL185,"The precise mechanism of action has not been fully determined, but the main mechanism of fluorouracil is thought to be the binding of the deoxyribonucleotide of the drug (FdUMP) and the folate cofactor, N5–10-methylenetetrahydrofolate, to thymidylate synthase (TS) to form a covalently bound ternary complex. This results in the inhibition of the formation of thymidylate from uracil, which leads to the inhibition of DNA and RNA synthesis and cell death. Fluorouracil can also be incorporated into RNA in place of uridine triphosphate (UTP), producing a fraudulent RNA and interfering with RNA processing and protein synthesis."
DB00545,Pyridostigmine,CHEMBL1115,"Pyridostigmine inhibits acetylcholinesterase in the synaptic cleft by competing with acetylcholine for attachment to acetylcholinesterase, thus slowing down the hydrolysis of acetylcholine, and thereby increases efficiency of cholinergic transmission in the neuromuscular junction and prolonges the effects of acetylcholine."
DB00546,Adinazolam,CHEMBL328250,"Adinazolam binds to peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptors which interact allosterically with GABA receptors. This potentiates the effects of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA, increasing the inhibition of the ascending reticular activating system and blocking the cortical and limbic arousal that occurs following stimulation of the reticular pathways."
DB00547,Desoximetasone,CHEMBL1766,"The precise mechanism of the antiinflammatory activity of topical steroids in the treatment of steroid-responsive dermatoses, in general, is uncertain. However, corticosteroids are thought to act by the induction of phospholipase A<sub>2</sub> inhibitory proteins, collectively called lipocortins. This is achieved first by the drug binding to the glucocorticoid receptors which then translocates into the nucleus and binds to DNA causing various activations and repressions of genes. It is postulated that these proteins control the biosynthesis of potent mediators of inflammation such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes by inhibiting the release of their common precursor arachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid is released from membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A<sub>2</sub>."
DB00548,Azelaic Acid,CHEMBL1238,"The exact mechanism of action of azelaic acid is not known. It is thought that azelaic acid manifests its antibacterial effects by inhibiting the synthesis of cellular protein in anaerobic and aerobic bacteria, especially <i>Staphylococcus epidermidis</i> and <i>Propionibacterium acnes</i>. In aerobic bacteria, azelaic acid reversibly inhibits several oxidoreductive enzymes including tyrosinase, mitochondrial enzymes of the respiratory chain, thioredoxin reductase, 5-alpha-reductase, and DNA polymerases. In anaerobic bacteria, azelaic acid impedes glycolysis. Along with these actions, azelaic acid also improves acne vulgaris by normalizing the keratin process and decreasing microcomedo formation. Azelaic acid may be effective against both inflamed and noninflamed lesions. Specifically, azelaic acid reduces the thickness of the stratum corneum, shrinks keratohyalin granules by reducing the amount and distribution of filaggrin (a component of keratohyalin) in epidermal layers, and lowers the number of keratohyalin granules."
DB00549,Zafirlukast,CHEMBL603,"Zafirlukast is a selective and competitive receptor antagonist of leukotriene D4 and E4 (LTD<sub>4</sub> and LTE4), components of slow-reacting substance of anaphylaxis (SRSA). Cysteinyl leukotriene production and receptor occupation have been correlated with the pathophysiology of asthma, including airway edema, smooth muscle constriction, and altered cellular activity associated with the inflammatory process, which contribute to the signs and symptoms of asthma."
DB00550,Propylthiouracil,CHEMBL1518,"Propylthiouracil binds to thyroid peroxidase and thereby inhibits the conversion of iodide to iodine. Thyroid peroxidase normally converts iodide to iodine (via hydrogen peroxide as a cofactor) and also catalyzes the incorporation of the resulting iodide molecule onto both the 3 and/or 5 positions of the phenol rings of tyrosines found in thyroglobulin. Thyroglobulin is degraded to produce thyroxine (T4) and tri-iodothyronine (T3), which are the main hormones produced by the thyroid gland. Therefore propylthiouracil effectively inhibits the production of new thyroid hormones."
DB00551,Acetohydroxamic Acid,CHEMBL734,"Acetohydroxamic Acid reversibly inhibits the bacterial enzyme urease. This inhibits the hydrolysis of urea and production of ammonia in urine infected with urea-splitting organisms, leading to a decrease in pH and ammonia levels. As antimicrobial agents are more effective in such conditions, the effectiveness of these agents is amplified, resulting in a higher cure rate."
DB00552,Pentostatin,CHEMBL1580,"Pentostatin is a potent transition state inhibitor of adenosine deaminase (ADA), the greatest activity of which is found in cells of the lymphoid system. T-cells have higher ADA activity than B-cells, and T-cell malignancies have higher activity than B-cell malignancies. The cytotoxicity that results from prevention of catabolism of adenosine or deoxyadenosine is thought to be due to elevated intracellular levels of dATP, which can block DNA synthesis through inhibition of ribonucleotide reductase. Intracellular activation results in incorporation into DNA as a false purine base. An additional cytotoxic effect is related to its incorporation into RNA. Cytotoxicity is cell cycle phase-specific (S-phase)."
DB00553,Methoxsalen,CHEMBL416,"After activation it binds preferentially to the guanine and cytosine moieties of DNA, leading to cross-linking of DNA, thus inhibiting DNA synthesis and function."
DB00554,Piroxicam,CHEMBL527,"The antiinflammatory effect of Piroxicam may result from the reversible inhibition of cyclooxygenase, causing the peripheral inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis. The prostaglandins are produced by an enzyme called Cox-1. Piroxicam blocks the Cox-1 enzyme, resulting into the disruption of production of prostaglandins. Piroxicam also inhibits the migration of leukocytes into sites of inflammation and prevents the formation of thromboxane A2, an aggregating agent, by the platelets."
DB00555,Lamotrigine,CHEMBL741,"One proposed mechanism of action of Lamotrigine, the relevance of which remains to be established in humans, involves an effect on sodium channels. <i>in vitro</i> pharmacological studies suggest that lamotrigine inhibits voltage-sensitive sodium channels and/or calcium channels, thereby stabilizing neuronal membranes and consequently modulating presynaptic transmitter release of excitatory amino acids (e.g., glutamate and aspartate). Studies on lamotrigine show binding to sodium channels similar to local anesthetics. "
DB00556,Perflutren,CHEMBL1663,"Perflutren is comprised of gas-filled microspheres that are injected or infused into the body. When exposed to ultrasound waves, the microspheres resonate and ""echo"" strong signals back to the ultrasound machine. The difference in density between the gas-filled bubbles and the blood around them creates an increased level of contrast visible in the resulting ultrasound image. During echocardiography, activated Perflutren enhances images of the inner edges or borders of the heart, producing an improved image that may enable physicians to better diagnose patients."
DB00557,Hydroxyzine,CHEMBL896,"Hydroxyzine competes with histamine for binding at H<sub>1</sub>-receptor sites on the effector cell surface, resulting in suppression of histaminic edema, flare, and pruritus. The sedative properties of hydroxyzine occur at the subcortical level of the CNS. Secondary to its central anticholinergic actions, hydroxyzine may be effective as an antiemetic."
DB00558,Zanamivir,CHEMBL222813,"The proposed mechanism of action of zanamivir is via inhibition of influenza virus neuraminidase with the possibility of alteration of virus particle aggregation and release. By binding and inhibiting the neuraminidase protein, the drug renders the influenza virus unable to escape its host cell and infect others."
DB00559,Bosentan,CHEMBL957,"Endothelin-1 (ET-1) is a neurohormone, the effects of which are mediated by binding to ET<sub>A</sub> and ET<sub>B</sub> receptors in the endothelium and vascular smooth muscle. ET-1 concentrations are elevated in plasma and lung tissue of patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension, suggesting a pathogenic role for ET-1 in this disease. Bosentan is a specific and competitive antagonist at endothelin receptor types ET<sub>A</sub> and ET<sub>B</sub>. Bosentan has a slightly higher affinity for ET<sub>A</sub> receptors than for ET<sub>B</sub> receptors."
DB00560,Tigecycline,CHEMBL376140,"Tigecycline, a glycylcycline, inhibits protein translation in bacteria by binding to the 30S ribosomal subunit and blocking entry of amino-acyl tRNA molecules into the A site of the ribosome. This prevents incorporation of amino acid residues into elongating peptide chains. Tigecycline carries a glycylamido moiety attached to the 9-position of minocycline. The substitution pattern is not present in any naturally occurring or semisynthetic tetracycline and imparts certain microbiologic properties to tigecycline. Tigecycline is not affected by the two major tetracycline resistance mechanisms, ribosomal protection and efflux. Accordingly, tigecycline has demonstrated in vitro and in vivo activity against a broad spectrum of bacterial pathogens. There has been no cross resistance observed between tigecycline and other antibiotics. Tigecycline is not affected by resistance mechanisms such as beta-lactamases (including extended spectrum beta-lactamases), target site modifications, macrolide efflux pumps or enzyme target changes (e.g. gyrase/topoisomerase). In vitro studies have not demonstrated antagonism between tigecycline and other commonly used antibacterial drugs. In general, tigecycline is considered bacteriostatic."
DB00561,Doxapram,CHEMBL1754,Doxapram produces respiratory stimulation mediated through the peripheral carotid chemoreceptors. It is thought to stimulate the carotid body by inhibiting certain potassium channels.
DB00562,Benzthiazide,CHEMBL1201039,"As a diuretic, benzthiazide inhibits active chloride reabsorption at the early distal tubule via the Na-Cl cotransporter, resulting in an increase in the excretion of sodium, chloride, and water. Thiazides like benzthiazide also inhibit sodium ion transport across the renal tubular epithelium through binding to the thiazide sensitive sodium-chloride transporter. This results in an increase in potassium excretion via the sodium-potassium exchange mechanism. The antihypertensive mechanism of benzthiazide is less well understood although it may be mediated through its action on carbonic anhydrases in the smooth muscle or through its action on the large-conductance calcium-activated potassium (KCa) channel, also found in the smooth muscle."
DB00563,Methotrexate,CHEMBL34259,"Methotrexate anti-tumor activity is a result of the inhibition of folic acid reductase, leading to inhibition of DNA synthesis and inhibition of cellular replication. The mechanism involved in its activity against rheumatoid arthritis is not known."
DB00564,Carbamazepine,CHEMBL108,"Carbamazepine inhibits sustained repetitive firing by blocking use-dependent sodium channels. Pain relief is believed to be associated with blockade of synaptic transmission in the trigeminal nucleus and seizure control with reduction of post-tetanic potentiation of synaptic transmission in the spinal cord. Carbamazepine also possesses anticholinergic, central antidiuretic, antiarrhythmic, muscle relaxant, antidepressant (possibly through blockade of norepinephrine release), sedative, and neuromuscular-blocking properties."
DB00565,Cisatracurium besylate,CHEMBL1200641,"Cisatracurium Besylate binds to the nicotinic acetycholine (cholinergic) receptors in the motor endplate and blocks access to the receptors. In the process of binding, the receptor is actually activated - causing a process known as depolarization. Since it is not degraded in the neuromuscular junction, the depolarized membrane remains depolarized and unresponsive to any other impulse, causing muscle paralysis."
DB00566,Succimer,CHEMBL1201073,"Succimer is a heavy metal chelator. It binds with high specificity to ions of lead in the blood to form a water-soluble complex that is subsequently excreted by the kidneys. Succimer can also chelate mercury, cadmium, and arsenic in this manner."
DB00567,Cephalexin,CHEMBL1727,"Cephalexin, like the penicillins, is a beta-lactam antibiotic. By binding to specific penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) located inside the bacterial cell wall, it inhibits the third and last stage of bacterial cell wall synthesis. Cell lysis is then mediated by bacterial cell wall autolytic enzymes such as autolysins; it is possible that cephalexin interferes with an autolysin inhibitor."
DB00568,Cinnarizine,CHEMBL43064,"Cinnarizine inhibits contractions of vascular smooth muscle cells by blocking L-type and T-type voltage gated calcium channels. Cinnarizine has also been implicated in binding to dopamine D2 receptors, histamine H1 receptors, and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. "
DB00569,Fondaparinux sodium,CHEMBL1200644,"The antithrombotic activity of fondaparinux is the result of ATIII-mediated selective inhibition of Factor Xa. By selectively binding to ATIII, Fondaparinux potentiates (about 300 times) the neutralization of Factor Xa by ATIII. Neutralization of Factor Xa interrupts the blood coagulation cascade and thus inhibits thrombin formation and thrombus development. It is thought that fondaparinux is unlikely to induce thrombocytopenia via a heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT)-like mechanism given its chemical structure (PMID 19825921). As a result, fondaparinux has been used as an alternative anticoagulant in heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) patients (PMID 19737996, 19432027, 18217156). However, it is important to note that rare cases of HIT have been reported in patients treated with fondaparinux (PMID 20351685, 20351686). "
DB00570,Vinblastine,CHEMBL159,"The antitumor activity of vinblastine is thought to be due primarily to inhibition of mitosis at metaphase through its interaction with tubulin. Vinblastine binds to the microtubular proteins of the mitotic spindle, leading to crystallization of the microtubule and mitotic arrest or cell death."
DB00571,Propranolol,CHEMBL27,"Propranolol competes with sympathomimetic neurotransmitters such as catecholamines for binding at beta(1)-adrenergic receptors in the heart, inhibiting sympathetic stimulation. This results in a reduction in resting heart rate, cardiac output, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and reflex orthostatic hypotension."
DB00572,Atropine,CHEMBL517712,"Atropine binds to and inhibit muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, producing a wide range of anticholinergic effects."
DB00573,Fenoprofen,CHEMBL1297,"Fenoprofen's exact mode of action is unknown, but it is thought that prostaglandin synthetase inhibition is involved. Fenoprofen has been shown to inhibit prostaglandin synthetase isolated from bovine seminal vesicles."
DB00574,Fenfluramine,CHEMBL87493,Fenfluramine binds to the serotonin reuptake pump. This causes inhbition of serotonin uptake and release of serotonin. The increased levels of serotonin lead to greater serotonin receptor activation which in turn lead to enhancement of serotoninergic transmission in the centres of feeding behavior located in the hypothalamus. This suppresses the appetite for carbohydrates.
DB00575,Clonidine,CHEMBL134,See Pharmacology section above. 
DB00576,Sulfamethizole,CHEMBL1191,Sulfamethizole is a competitive inhibitor of bacterial enzyme dihydropteroate synthetase. The normal para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) substrate is prevented from binding. The inhibited reaction is necessary in these organisms for the synthesis of folic acid.
DB00577,Valaciclovir,CHEMBL1349,"Valaciclovir is phosphorylated by viral thymidine kinase to acyclovir triphosphate (the active metabolite) which then inhibits herpes viral DNA replication by competitive inhibition of viral DNA polymerase, and by incorporation into and termination of the growing viral DNA chain. When used as a substrate for viral DNA polymerase, acyclovir triphosphate competitively inhibits dATP leading to the formation of 'faulty' DNA. This is where acyclovir triphosphate is incorporated into the DNA strand replacing many of the adenosine bases. This results in the prevention of DNA synthesis, as phosphodiester bridges can longer to be built, destabilizing the strand."
DB00578,Carbenicillin,CHEMBL1214,"Free carbenicillin is the predominant pharmacologically active fraction of the salt. Carbenicillin exerts its antibacterial activity by interference with final cell wall synthesis of susceptible bacteria. Penicillins acylate the penicillin-sensitive transpeptidase C-terminal domain by opening the lactam ring. This inactivation of the enzyme prevents the formation of a cross-link of two linear peptidoglycan strands, inhibiting the third and last stage of bacterial cell wall synthesis. Cell lysis is then mediated by bacterial cell wall autolytic enzymes such as autolysins; it is possible that carbenicillin interferes with an autolysin inhibitor."
DB00579,Mazindol,CHEMBL781,"Although the mechanism of action of the sympathomimetics in the treatment of obesity is not fully known, these medications have pharmacological effects similar to those of amphetamines. Unlike other sympathomimetic appetite suppressants such as phentermine, mazindol is thought to inhibit the reuptake of norepinephrine rather than to cause its release."
DB00580,Valdecoxib,CHEMBL865,"Both COX-1 and COX-2 catalyze the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandin (PG) H2, the precursor of PGs and thromboxane. Valdecoxib selectively inhibits the cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) enzyme, important for the mediation of inflammation and pain. Unlike non-selective NSAIDs, valdecoxib does not inhibit platelet aggregation."
DB00581,Lactulose,CHEMBL296306,"Lactulose is a synthetic sugar used in the treatment of constipation and liver disease. It consists of the monosaccharides fructose and galactose. In the colon, lactulose is broken down primarily to lactic acid, and also to small amounts of formic and acetic acids, by the action of via evolved-beta galactosidase from colonic bacteria, which results in an increase in osmotic pressure and slight acidification of the colonic contents. This in turn causes an increase in stool water content and softens the stool. In treating heptic diseases (hepatic encephalopathy) it is thought that lactulose draws out ammonia from the body in the same way that it draws out water into the colon."
DB00582,Voriconazole,CHEMBL638,Voriconazole binds and inhibits ergosterol synthesis by inhibiting CYP450-dependent 14-alpha sterol demethylase. The inhibition of 14-alpha sterol demethylase results in a depletion of ergosterol in fungal cell membrane.
DB00583,L-Carnitine,CHEMBL1149,"Levocarnitine can be synthesised within the body from the amino acids lysine or methionine. Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) is essential to the synthesis of carnitine. Levocarnitine is a carrier molecule in the transport of long chain fatty acids across the inner mitochondrial membrane. It also exports acyl groups from subcellular organelles and from cells to urine before they accumulate to toxic concentrations. Only the L isomer of carnitine (sometimes called vitamin BT) affects lipid metabolism. Levocarnitine is handled by several proteins in different pathways including carnitine transporters, carnitine translocases, carnitine acetyltransferases and carnitine palmitoyltransferases."
DB00584,Enalapril,CHEMBL578,"There are two isoforms of ACE: the somatic isoform, which exists as a glycoprotein comprised of a single polypeptide chain of 1277; and the testicular isoform, which has a lower molecular mass and is thought to play a role in sperm maturation and binding of sperm to the oviduct epithelium. Somatic ACE has two functionally active domains, N and C, which arise from tandem gene duplication. Although the two domains have high sequence similarity, they play distinct physiological roles. The C-domain is predominantly involved in blood pressure regulation while the N-domain plays a role in hematopoietic stem cell differentiation and proliferation. ACE inhibitors bind to and inhibit the activity of both domains, but have much greater affinity for and inhibitory activity against the C-domain. Enalaprilat, the principle active metabolite of enalapril, competes with ATI for binding to ACE and inhibits and enzymatic proteolysis of ATI to ATII. Decreasing ATII levels in the body decreases blood pressure by inhibiting the pressor effects of ATII as described in the Pharmacology section above. Enalapril also causes an increase in plasma renin activity likely due to a loss of feedback inhibition mediated by ATII on the release of renin and/or stimulation of reflex mechanisms via baroreceptors. Enalaprilat's affinity for ACE is approximately 200,000 times greater than that of ATI and 300-1000 times greater than that enalapril. "
DB00585,Nizatidine,CHEMBL3183075,"Nizatidine competes with histamine for binding at the H<sub>2</sub>-receptors on the gastric basolateral membrane of parietal cells. Competitive inhibition results in reduction of basal and nocturnal gastric acid secretions. The drug also decreases the gastric acid response to stimuli such as food, caffeine, insulin, betazole, or pentagastrin."
DB00586,Diclofenac,CHEMBL139,"The antiinflammatory effects of diclofenac are believed to be due to inhibition of both leukocyte migration and the enzyme cylooxygenase (COX-1 and COX-2), leading to the peripheral inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis. As prostaglandins sensitize pain receptors, inhibition of their synthesis is responsible for the analgesic effects of diclofenac. Antipyretic effects may be due to action on the hypothalamus, resulting in peripheral dilation, increased cutaneous blood flow, and subsequent heat dissipation."
DB00587,Cinalukast,CHEMBL283754,"Binds to the cysteinyl leukotriene receptor. The cysteinyl leukotrienes (LTC4, LTD<sub>4</sub>, LTE4) are products of arachidonic acid metabolism and are released from various cells, including mast cells and eosinophils. These eicosanoids bind to cysteinyl leukotriene receptors (CysLT) found in the human airway. Cysteinyl leukotrienes and leukotriene receptor occupation have been correlated with the pathophysiology of asthma, including airway edema, smooth muscle contraction, and altered cellular activity associated with the inflammatory process, which contribute to the signs and symptoms of asthma."
DB00588,Fluticasone propionate,CHEMBL1473,"Binds to the glucocorticoid receptor. Unbound corticosteroids cross the membranes of cells such as mast cells and eosinophils, binding with high affinity to glucocorticoid receptors (GR). The results include alteration of transcription and protein synthesis, a decreased release of leukocytic acid hydrolases, reduction in fibroblast proliferation, prevention of macrophage accumulation at inflamed sites, reduction of collagen deposition, interference with leukocyte adhesion to the capillary wall, reduction of capillary membrane permeability and subsequent edema, reduction of complement components, inhibition of histamine and kinin release, and interference with the formation of scar tissue. In the management of asthma, the glucocorticoid receptor complexes down-regulates proinflammatory mediators such as interleukin-(IL)-1, 3, and 5, and up-regulates anti-inflammatory mediators such as IkappaB [inhibitory molecule for nuclear factor kappaB1], IL-10, and IL-12. The antiinflammatory actions of corticosteroids are also thought to involve inhibition of cytosolic phospholipase A2 (through activation of lipocortin-1 (annexin)) which controls the biosynthesis of potent mediators of inflammation such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes."
DB00589,Lisuride,CHEMBL157138,"Lisuride is an anti-Parkinson drug chemically related to the dopaminergic ergoline Parkinson's drugs. Lisuride binds to the 5-HT(1A) and 5-HT(2A/2C) receptors.  It is also thought to bind to the dopamine receptor and to act as a dopamine agonist. Evidence has also emerged that Lisuride also binds to the Histamine H1 receptor.  Lisuride is also used to lower prolactin and, in low doses, to prevent migraine attacks. "
DB00590,Doxazosin,CHEMBL707,"Doxazosin acts by inhibiting the postsynaptic alpha(1)-adrenoceptors on vascular smooth muscle. This inhibits the vasoconstrictor effect of circulating and locally released catecholamines (epinephrine and norepinephrine), resulting in peripheral vasodilation."
DB00591,Fluocinolone Acetonide,CHEMBL989,"Fluocinolone Acetonide is a corticosteroid that binds to the cytosolic glucocorticoid receptor. After binding the receptor the newly formed receptor-ligand complex translocates itself into the cell nucleus, where it binds to many glucocorticoid response elements (GRE) in the promoter region of the target genes. The DNA bound receptor then interacts with basic transcription factors, causing the increase in expression of specific target genes. The anti-inflammatory actions of corticosteroids are thought to involve lipocortins, phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins which, through inhibition arachidonic acid, control the biosynthesis of prostaglandins and leukotrienes. Specifically glucocorticoids induce lipocortin-1 (annexin-1) synthesis, which then binds to cell membranes preventing the phospholipase A2 from coming into contact with its substrate arachidonic acid. This leads to diminished eicosanoid production. Cyclooxygenase (both COX-1 and COX-2) expression is also suppressed, potentiating the effect. In another words, the two main products in inflammation Prostaglandins and Leukotrienes are inhibited by the action of Glucocorticoids. Glucocorticoids also stimulate the lipocortin-1 escaping to the extracellular space, where it binds to the leukocyte membrane receptors and inhibits various inflammatory events: epithelial adhesion, emigration, chemotaxis, phagocytosis, respiratory burst and the release of various inflammatory mediators (lysosomal enzymes, cytokines, tissue plasminogen activator, chemokines etc.) from neutrophils, macrophages and mastocytes. Additionally the immune system is suppressed by corticosteroids due to a decrease in the function of the lymphatic system, a reduction in immunoglobulin and complement concentrations, the precipitation of lymphocytopenia, and interference with antigen-antibody binding.  Like other glucocorticoid agents Fluocinolone acetonide acts as a physiological antagonist to insulin by decreasing glycogenesis (formation of glycogen).  It also promotes the breakdown of lipids (lipolysis), and proteins, leading to the mobilization of extrahepatic amino acids and ketone bodies. This leads to increased circulating glucose concentrations (in the blood). There is also decreased glycogen formation in the liver."
DB00592,Piperazine,CHEMBL1412,"Piperazine is a GABA receptor agonist. Piperzine binds directly and selectively to muscle membrane GABA receptors, presumably causing hyperpolarization of nerve endings, resulting in flaccid paralysis of the worm. While the worm is paralyzed, it is dislodged from the intestinal lumen and expelled live from the body by normal intestinal peristalsis."
DB00593,Ethosuximide,CHEMBL696,"Binds to T-type voltage sensitive calcium channels. Voltage-sensitive calcium channels (VSCC) mediate the entry of calcium ions into excitable cells and are also involved in a variety of calcium-dependent processes, including muscle contraction, hormone or neurotransmitter release, gene expression, cell motility, cell division and cell death. The isoform alpha-1G gives rise to T-type calcium currents. T-type calcium channels belong to the ""low-voltage activated (LVA)"" group and are strongly blocked by mibefradil. A particularity of this type of channels is an opening at quite negative potentials and a voltage-dependent inactivation. T-type channels serve pacemaking functions in both central neurons and cardiac nodal cells and support calcium signaling in secretory cells and vascular smooth muscle. They may also be involved in the modulation of firing patterns of neurons which is important for information processing as well as in cell growth processes."
DB00594,Amiloride,CHEMBL945,"Amiloride works by inhibiting sodium reabsorption in the distal convoluted tubules and collecting ducts in the kidneys by binding to the amiloride-sensitive sodium channels. This promotes the loss of sodium and water from the body, but without depleting potassium. Amiloride exerts its potassium sparing effect through the inhibition of sodium reabsorption at the distal convoluted tubule, cortical collecting tubule and collecting duct; this decreases the net negative potential of the tubular lumen and reduces both potassium and hydrogen secretion and their subsequent excretion. Amiloride is not an aldosterone antagonist and its effects are seen even in the absence of aldosterone."
DB00595,Oxytetracycline,CHEMBL1517,Oxytetracycline inhibits cell growth by inhibiting translation. It binds to the 30S ribosomal subunit and prevents the amino-acyl tRNA from binding to the A site of the ribosome. The binding is reversible in nature. Oxytetracycline is lipophilic and can easily pass through the cell membrane or passively diffuses through porin channels in the bacterial membrane.
DB00596,Ulobetasol,CHEMBL1201360,"Halobetasol propionate is thought to act by the induction of phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins, collectively called lipocortins. It is postulated that these proteins control the biosynthesis of potent mediators of inflammation such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes by inhibiting the release of their common precursor arachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid is released from membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A2. The initial interaction, however, is due to the drug binding to the cytosolic glucocorticoid receptor. After binding the receptor the newly formed receptor-ligand complex translocates itself into the cell nucleus, where it binds to many glucocorticoid response elements (GRE) in the promoter region of the target genes. The DNA bound receptor then interacts with basic transcription factors, causing the increase in expression of specific target genes."
DB00597,Gadoteridol,CHEMBL1200593,"Based on the behavior of protons when placed in a strong magnetic field, which is interpreted and transformed into images by magnetic resonance (MR) instruments. Paramagnetic agents have unpaired electrons that generate a magnetic field about 700 times larger than the proton's field, thus disturbing the proton's local magnetic field. When the local magnetic field around a proton is disturbed its relaxation process is altered. MR images are based on proton density and proton relaxation dynamics. MR instruments can record two different relaxation processes, the T1 (spin-lattice or longitudinal relaxation time) and T2 (spin-spin or transverse relaxation time). In MRI, visualization of normal and pathological brain tissue depends in part on variations in the radiofrequency signal intensity that occur with changes in proton density, alteration of the T1, and variation in T2. When placed in a magnetic field, gadoteridol shortens the T1 relaxation time in tissues where it accumulates. Gadoteridol does not cross the intact blood-brain barrier; therefore, it does not accumulate in normal brain tissue or in central nervous system (CNS) lesions that have not caused an abnormal blood-brain barrier (e.g., cysts, mature post-operative scars). Abnormal vascularity or disruption of the blood-brain barrier allows accumulation of gadoteridol in lesions such as neoplasms, abscesses, and subacute infarcts."
DB00598,Labetalol,CHEMBL429,"Labetalol HCl combines both selective, competitive, alpha-1-adrenergic blocking and nonselective, competitive, beta-adrenergic blocking activity in a single substance. In man, the ratios of alpha- to beta- blockade have been estimated to be approximately 1:3 and 1:7 following oral and intravenous (IV) administration, respectively. The principal physiologic action of labetalol is to competitively block adrenergic stimulation of β-receptors within the myocardium (β1-receptors) and within bronchial and vascular smooth muscle (β2-receptors), and α1-receptors within vascular smooth muscle. This causes a decrease in systemic arterial blood pressure and systemic vascular resistance without a substantial reduction in resting heart rate, cardiac output, or stroke volume, apparently because of its combined α- and β-adrenergic blocking activity."
DB00599,Thiopental,CHEMBL441,"Thiopental binds at a distinct binding site associated with a Cl<sup>-</sup> ionopore at the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor, increasing the duration of time for which the Cl<sup>-</sup> ionopore is open. The post-synaptic inhibitory effect of GABA in the thalamus is, therefore, prolonged."
DB00600,Monobenzone,CHEMBL1388,"Monobenzone is a depigmenting agent whose mechanism of action is not fully understood. The topical application of monobenzone in animals, increases the excretion of melanin from the melanocytes. The same action is thought to be responsible for the depigmenting effect of the drug in humans. Monobenzone may cause destruction of melanocytes and permanent depigmentation. This effect is erratic and may take one to four months to occur while existing melanin is lost with normal sloughing of the stratum corneum. Hyperpigmented skin appears to fade more rapidly than does normal skin, and exposure to sunlight reduces the depigmenting effect of the drug. The histology of the skin after depigmentation with topical monobenzone is the same as that seen in vitiligo; the epidermis is normal except for the absence of identifiable melanocytes."
DB00601,Linezolid,CHEMBL126,"Linezolid is a synthetic antibacterial agent of the oxazolidinone class of antibiotics. It has in vitro activity against aerobic Gram positive bacteria, certain Gram negative bacteria and anaerobic microorganisms. It selectively inhibits bacterial protein synthesis through binding to sites on the bacterial ribosome and prevents the formation of a functional 70S-initiation complex. Specifically, linezolid binds to a site on the bacterial 23S ribosomal RNA of the 50S subunit and prevents the formation of a functional 70S initiation complex, which is an essential component of the bacterial translation process. The results of time-kill studies have shown linezolid to be bacteriostatic against enterococci and staphylococci. For streptococci, linezolid was found to be bactericidal for the majority of strains. Linezolid is also a reversible, nonselective inhibitor of monoamine oxidase. Therefore, linezolid has the potential for interaction with adrenergic and serotonergic agents."
DB00602,Ivermectin,CHEMBL1200633,"Ivermectin binds selectively and with high affinity to glutamate-gated chloride ion channels in invertebrate muscle and nerve cells of the microfilaria. This binding causes an increase in the permeability of the cell membrane to chloride ions and results in hyperpolarization of the cell, leading to paralysis and death of the parasite. Ivermectin also is believed to act as an agonist of the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), thereby disrupting GABA-mediated central nervous system (CNS) neurosynaptic transmission. Ivermectin may also impair normal intrauterine development of O. volvulus microfilariae and may inhibit their release from the uteri of gravid female worms."
DB00603,Medroxyprogesterone acetate,CHEMBL717,"Progestins diffuse freely into target cells in the female reproductive tract, mammary gland, hypothalamus, and the pituitary and bind to the progesterone receptor. Once bound to the receptor, progestins slow the frequency of release of gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) from the hypothalamus and blunt the pre-ovulatory LH surge."
DB00604,Cisapride,CHEMBL560739,"Cisapride acts through the stimulation of the serotonin 5-HT<sub>4</sub> receptors which increases acetylcholine release in the enteric nervous system (specifically the myenteric plexus). This results in increased tone and amplitude of gastric (especially antral) contractions, relaxation of the pyloric sphincter and the duodenal bulb, and increased peristalsis of the duodenum and jejunum resulting in accelerated gastric emptying and intestinal transit."
DB00605,Sulindac,CHEMBL15770,"Sulindac's exact mechanism of action is unknown. Its antiinflammatory effects are believed to be due to inhibition of both COX-1 and COX-2 which leads to the inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis. Antipyretic effects may be due to action on the hypothalamus, resulting in an increased peripheral blood flow, vasodilation, and subsequent heat dissipation."
DB00606,Cyclothiazide,CHEMBL61593,"Hydrochlorothiazide, a thiazide diuretic, inhibits water reabsorption in the nephron by inhibiting the sodium-chloride symporter (SLC12A3) in the distal convoluted tubule, which is responsible for 5% of total sodium reabsorption. Normally, the sodium-chloride symporter transports sodium and chloride from the lumen into the epithelial cell lining the distal convoluted tubule. The energy for this is provided by a sodium gradient established by sodium-potassium ATPases on the basolateral membrane. Once sodium has entered the cell, it is transported out into the basolateral interstitium via the sodium-potassium ATPase, causing an increase in the osmolarity of the interstitium, thereby establishing an osmotic gradient for water reabsorption. By blocking the sodium-chloride symporter, hydrochlorothiazide effectively reduces the osmotic gradient and water reabsorption throughout the nephron.Hydrochlorothiazide, a thiazide diuretic, inhibits water reabsorption in the nephron by inhibiting the sodium-chloride symporter (SLC12A3) in the distal convoluted tubule, which is responsible for 5% of total sodium reabsorption.

DB00607,Nafcillin,CHEMBL1443,"Like other penicillins, nafcillin exerts a bactericidal action against penicillin-susceptible microorganisms during the state of active multiplication in the bacterial cell wall synthesis [FDA Label]. It inhibits the biosynthesis of the bacterial cell wall by forming covalent bonds with penicillin-binding proteins that play a critical role in the final transpeptidation process. Binding to penicillin-binding proteins inhibits the transpeptidase and carboxypeptidase activities conferred by these proteins and prevents the formation of the crosslinks [T28]. "
DB00608,Chloroquine,CHEMBL76,"The mechanism of plasmodicidal action of chloroquine is not completely certain. Like other quinoline derivatives, it is thought to inhibit heme polymerase activity. This results in accumulation of free heme, which is toxic to the parasites.  nside red blood cells, the malarial parasite must degrade hemoglobin to acquire essential amino acids, which the parasite requires to construct its own protein and for energy metabolism. Digestion is carried out in a vacuole of the parasite cell.

During this process, the parasite produces the toxic and soluble molecule heme. The heme moiety consists of a porphyrin ring called Fe(II)-protoporphyrin IX (FP). To avoid destruction by this molecule, the parasite biocrystallizes heme to form hemozoin, a non-toxic molecule. Hemozoin collects in the digestive vacuole as insoluble crystals.

Chloroquine enters the red blood cell, inhabiting parasite cell, and digestive vacuole by simple diffusion. Chloroquine then becomes protonated (to CQ2+), as the digestive vacuole is known to be acidic (pH 4.7); chloroquine then cannot leave by diffusion. Chloroquine caps hemozoin molecules to prevent further biocrystallization of heme, thus leading to heme buildup. Chloroquine binds to heme (or FP) to form what is known as the FP-Chloroquine complex; this complex is highly toxic to the cell and disrupts membrane function. Action of the toxic FP-Chloroquine and FP results in cell lysis and ultimately parasite cell autodigestion. In essence, the parasite cell drowns in its own metabolic products."
DB00609,Ethionamide,CHEMBL1441,"Ethionamide may be bacteriostatic or bactericidal in action, depending on the concentration of the drug attained at the site of infection and the susceptibility of the infecting organism. Ethionamide, like prothionamide and pyrazinamide, is a nicotinic acid derivative related to isoniazid. It is thought that ethionamide undergoes intracellular modification and acts in a similar fashion to isoniazid. Isoniazid inhibits the synthesis of mycoloic acids, an essential component of the bacterial cell wall. Specifically isoniazid inhibits InhA, the enoyl reductase from <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i>, by forming a covalent adduct with the NAD cofactor. It is the INH-NAD adduct that acts as a slow, tight-binding competitive inhibitor of InhA."
DB00610,Metaraminol,CHEMBL1201319,"Metaraminol acts through peripheral vasoconstriction by acting as a pure alpha-1 adrenergic receptor agonist, consequently increasing systemic blood pressure (both systolic &amp; diastolic). Its effect is thought to be associated with the inhibition of adenyl cyclase which leads to an inhibition of the production of cAMP. Another effect of Metaraminol is that it releases norepinephrine from its storage sites indirectly."
DB00611,Butorphanol,CHEMBL33986,"The exact mechanism of action is unknown, but is believed to interact with an opiate receptor site in the CNS (probably in or associated with the limbic system). The opiate antagonistic effect may result from competitive inhibition at the opiate receptor, but may also be a result of other mechanisms. Butorphanol is a mixed agonist-antagonist that exerts antagonistic or partially antagonistic effects at mu opiate receptor sites, but is thought to exert its agonistic effects principally at the kappa and sigma opiate receptors."
DB00612,Bisoprolol,CHEMBL645,"Bisoprolol selectively blocks catecholamine stimulation of &beta;1-adrenergic receptors in the heart and vascular smooth muscle. This results in a reduction of heart rate, cardiac output, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and possibly reflex orthostatic hypotension. At higher doses (e.g. 20 mg and greater) bisoprolol may competitively block &beta;2-adrenergic receptors in bronchial and vascular smooth muscle causing bronchospasm and vasodilation. "

This drug-heme complex is toxic and disrupts membrane function."
DB00614,Furazolidone,CHEMBL1103,Furazolidone and its related free radical products are believed to bind DNA and induce cross-links. Bacterial DNA is particularly susceptible to this drug leading to high levels of mutations (transitions and transversions) in the bacterial chromosome.

DB00616,Candoxatril,CHEMBL35084,"Neutral endopeptidase inhibitors such as Candoxatril have a dual mechanism of action. They inhibit two metalloprotease enzymes, neutral endopeptidase and ACE, resulting in an increased availability of natriuretic peptides that exhibit vasodilatory effects and, possibly, tissue protective effects."
DB00617,Paramethadione,CHEMBL1100,Dione anticonvulsants such as paramethadione reduce T-type calcium currents in thalamic neurons (including thalamic relay neurons). This inhibits corticothalamic transmission and raises the threshold for repetitive activity in the thalamus. This results in a dampening of the abnormal thalamocortical rhythmicity proposed to underlie the 3-Hz spike-and-wave discharge seen on electroencephalogram (EEG) during absence seizures.
DB00618,Demeclocycline,CHEMBL1591,"Demeclocycline inhibits cell growth by inhibiting translation. It binds (reversibly) to the 30S and 50S ribosomal subunit and prevents the amino-acyl tRNA from binding to the A site of the ribosome, which impairs protein synthesis by bacteria. The binding is reversible in nature. The use in SIADH actually relies on a side-effect of tetracycline antibiotics; many may cause diabetes insipidus (dehydration due to the inability to concentrate urine). It is not completely understood why demeclocycline impairs the action of antidiuretic hormone, but it is thought that it blocks the binding of the hormone to its receptor."
DB00619,Imatinib,CHEMBL941,"Imatinib mesylate is a protein-tyrosine kinase inhibitor that inhibits the Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase, the constitutive abnormal tyrosine kinase created by the Philadelphia chromosome abnormality in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). It inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in Bcr-Abl positive cell lines as well as fresh leukemic cells from Philadelphia chromosome positive chronic myeloid leukemia. Imatinib also inhibits the receptor tyrosine kinases for platelet derived growth factor (PDGF) and stem cell factor (SCF) - called c-kit. Imatinib was identified in the late 1990s by Dr Brian J. Druker. Its development is an excellent example of rational drug design. Soon after identification of the bcr-abl target, the search for an inhibitor began. Chemists used a high-throughput screen of chemical libraries to identify the molecule 2-phenylaminopyrimidine. This lead compound was then tested and modified by the introduction of methyl and benzamide groups to give it enhanced binding properties, resulting in imatinib."
DB00620,Triamcinolone,CHEMBL1451,"The antiinflammatory actions of corticosteroids are thought to involve lipocortins, phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins which, through inhibition of arachidonic acid, control the biosynthesis of prostaglandins and leukotrienes. Firstly, however, these glucocorticoids bind to the glucocorticoid receptors which translocate into the nucleus and bind DNA (GRE) and change genetic expression both positively and negatively. The immune system is suppressed by corticosteroids due to a decrease in the function of the lymphatic system, a reduction in immunoglobulin and complement concentrations, the precipitation of lymphocytopenia, and interference with antigen-antibody binding."

DB00623,Fluphenazine,CHEMBL726,"Fluphenazine blocks postsynaptic mesolimbic dopaminergic D1 and D2 receptors in the brain; depresses the release of hypothalamic and hypophyseal hormones and is believed to depress the reticular activating system thus affecting basal metabolism, body temperature, wakefulness, vasomotor tone, and emesis."
DB00624,Testosterone,CHEMBL386630,"The effects of testosterone in humans and other vertebrates occur by way of two main mechanisms: by activation of the androgen receptor (directly or as DHT), and by conversion to estradiol and activation of certain estrogen receptors. Free testosterone (T) is transported into the cytoplasm of target tissue cells, where it can bind to the androgen receptor, or can be reduced to 5&alpha;-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) by the cytoplasmic enzyme 5&alpha;-reductase. DHT binds to the same androgen receptor even more strongly than T, so that its androgenic potency is about 2.5 times that of T. The T-receptor or DHT-receptor complex undergoes a structural change that allows it to move into the cell nucleus and bind directly to specific nucleotide sequences of the chromosomal DNA. The areas of binding are called hormone response elements (HREs), and influence transcriptional activity of certain genes, producing the androgen effects."
DB00625,Efavirenz,CHEMBL223228,"Similar to zidovudine, efavirenz inhibits the activity of viral RNA-directed DNA polymerase (i.e., reverse transcriptase). Antiviral activity of efavirenz is dependent on intracellular conversion to the active triphosphorylated form. The rate of efavirenz phosphorylation varies, depending on cell type. It is believed that inhibition of reverse transcriptase interferes with the generation of DNA copies of viral RNA, which, in turn, are necessary for synthesis of new virions. Intracellular enzymes subsequently eliminate the HIV particle that previously had been uncoated, and left unprotected, during entry into the host cell. Thus, reverse transcriptase inhibitors are virustatic and do not eliminate HIV from the body. Even though human DNA polymerase is less susceptible to the pharmacologic effects of triphosphorylated efavirenz, this action may nevertheless account for some of the drug's toxicity."
DB00626,Bacitracin,CHEMBL1200558,"Bacitracin intereferes with the dephosphorylation of the 55-carbon, biphosphate lipid transport molecule C55-isoprenyl pyrophosphate (undecaprenyl pyrophosphate), which carries the building blocks of the peptidoglycan bacterial cell wall outside the inner membrane for construction. Bacitracin binds divalent transition metal ions (Mn(II), Co(II), Ni(II), Cu(II), and Zn(II)) which binds and oxidatively cleave DNA. "
DB00627,Niacin,CHEMBL573,"Niacin binds to Nicotinate D-ribonucleotide phyrophsopate phosphoribosyltransferase, Nicotinic acid phosphoribosyltransferase, Nicotinate N-methyltransferase and the Niacin receptor. Niacin is the precursor to nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP), which are vital cofactors for dozens of enzymes. The mechanism by which niacin exerts its lipid lowering effects is not entirely understood, but may involve several actions, including a decrease in esterification of hepatic triglycerides. Niacin treatment also decreases the serum levels of apolipoprotein B-100 (apo B), the major protein component of the VLDL (very low-density lipoprotein) and LDL fractions."
DB00628,Clorazepate,CHEMBL1213252,"Benzodiazepines bind nonspecifically to benzodiazepine receptors BNZ1, which mediates sleep, and BNZ2, which affects affects muscle relaxation, anticonvulsant activity, motor coordination, and memory. As benzodiazepine receptors are thought to be coupled to gamma-aminobutyric acid-A (GABA<sub>A</sub>) receptors, this enhances the effects of GABA by increasing GABA affinity for the GABA receptor. Binding of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA to the site opens the chloride channel, resulting in a hyperpolarized cell membrane that prevents further excitation of the cell."
DB00629,Guanabenz,CHEMBL420,"Guanabenz's antihypertensive effect is thought to be due to central alpha-adrenergic stimulation, which results in a decreased sympathetic outflow to the heart, kidneys, and peripheral vasculature in addition to a decreased systolic and diastolic blood pressure and a slight slowing of pulse rate. Chronic administration of guanabenz also causes a decrease in peripheral vascular resistance."
DB00630,Alendronic acid,CHEMBL870,"The action of Alendronate on bone tissue is based partly on its affinity for hydroxyapatite, which is part of the mineral matrix of bone. Alendronate also targets farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) synthase. Nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates (such as pamidronate, alendronate, risedronate, ibandronate and zoledronate) appear to act as analogues of isoprenoid diphosphate lipids, thereby inhibiting FPP synthase, an enzyme in the mevalonate pathway. Inhibition of this enzyme in osteoclasts prevents the biosynthesis of isoprenoid lipids (FPP and GGPP) that are essential for the post-translational farnesylation and geranylgeranylation of small GTPase signalling proteins. This activity inhibits osteoclast activity and reduces bone resorption and turnover. In postmenopausal women, it reduces the elevated rate of bone turnover, leading to, on average, a net gain in bone mass."
DB00631,Clofarabine,CHEMBL1750,"Clofarabine is metabolized intracellularly to the active 5'-monophosphate metabolite by deoxycytidine kinase and 5'-triphosphate metabolite by mono- and di-phospho-kinases. This metabolite inhibits DNA synthesis through an inhibitory action on ribonucleotide reductase, and by terminating DNA chain elongation and inhibiting repair through competitive inhibition of DNA polymerases. This leads to the depletion of the intracellular deoxynucleotide triphosphate pool and the self-potentiation of clofarabine triphosphate incorporation into DNA, thereby intensifying the effectiveness of DNA synthesis inhibition. The affinity of clofarabine triphosphate for these enzymes is similar to or greater than that of deoxyadenosine triphosphate. In preclinical models, clofarabine has demonstrated the ability to inhibit DNA repair by incorporation into the DNA chain during the repair process. Clofarabine 5'-triphosphate also disrupts the integrity of mitochondrial membrane, leading to the release of the pro-apoptotic mitochondrial proteins, cytochrome C and apoptosis-inducing factor, leading to programmed cell death."
DB00632,Docosanol,CHEMBL1200453,"Docosanol works by inhibiting fusion between the human cell plasma membrane and the herpes simplex virus (HSV) envelope, thereby preventing viral entry into cells and subsequent viral replication. Unlike other cold-sore antivirals, docosanol does not act directly on the virus, and as such it is unlikely it will produce drug resistant mutants of HSV."
DB00633,Dexmedetomidine,CHEMBL778,"Dexmedetomidine is a specific and selective alpha-2 adrenoceptor agonist. By binding to the presynaptic alpha-2 adrenoceptors, it inhibits the release if norepinephrine, therefore, terminate the propagation of pain signals. Activation of the postsynaptic alpha-2 adrenoceptors inhibits the sympathetic activity decreases blood pressure and heart rate."
DB00634,Sulfacetamide,CHEMBL455,"Sulfacetamide is a competitive inhibitor of bacterial para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA), an essential component for bacterial growth (according to the Woods-Fildes theory). The inhibited reaction is necessary in these organisms for the synthesis of folic acid."
DB00635,Prednisone,CHEMBL635,"Prednisone is a glucocorticoid receptor agonist. It is first metabolized in the liver to its active form, prednisolone. Prednisolone crosses cell membranes and binds with high affinity to specific cytoplasmic receptors. The result includes inhibition of leukocyte infiltration at the site of inflammation, interference in the function of mediators of inflammatory response, suppression of humoral immune responses, and reduction in edema or scar tissue. The antiinflammatory actions of corticosteroids are thought to involve phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins, lipocortins, which control the biosynthesis of potent mediators of inflammation such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes. Prednisone can stimulate secretion of various components of gastric juice. Suppression of the production of corticotropin may lead to suppression of endogenous corticosteroids. Prednisone has slight mineralocorticoid activity, whereby entry of sodium into cells and loss of intracellular potassium is stimulated. This is particularly evident in the kidney, where rapid ion exchange leads to sodium retention and hypertension."
DB00636,Clofibrate,CHEMBL565,"Clofibrate increases the activity of extrahepatic lipoprotein lipase (LL), thereby increasing lipoprotein triglyceride lipolysis. Chylomicrons are degraded, VLDLs are converted to LDLs, and LDLs are converted to HDL. This is accompanied by a slight increase in secretion of lipids into the bile and ultimately the intestine. Clofibrate also inhibits the synthesis and increases the clearance of apolipoprotein B, a carrier molecule for VLDL. Also, as a fibrate, Clofibrate is an agonist of the PPAR-α receptor[4] in muscle, liver, and other tissues. This agonism ultimately leads to modification in gene expression resulting in increased beta-oxidation, decreased triglyceride secretion, increased HDL, increased lipoprotein lipase activity."
DB00637,Astemizole,CHEMBL296419,"Astemizole competes with histamine for binding at H<sub>1</sub>-receptor sites in the GI tract, uterus, large blood vessels, and bronchial muscle. This reversible binding of astemizole to H<sub>1</sub>-receptors suppresses the formation of edema, flare, and pruritus resulting from histaminic activity. As the drug does not readily cross the blood-brain barrier and preferentially binds at H1 receptors in the peripehery rather than within the brain, CNS depression is minimal. Astemizole may also act on H<sub>3</sub>-receptors, producing adverse effects."
DB00638,Inulin,CHEMBL1201646,"As a diagnostic agent, inulin is readily soluble and essentially indigestible. It readily passes through the blood and into the urine. It is neither secreted nor resorbed by the kidney making it an excellent indicator for renal clearance rates. The inulin clearance test has largely been succeeded by the creatinine clearance test as a measure of glomerular filtration rate. As a hypoglycemic agent, inulin is not digestible by human enzymes ptyalin and amylase, which are designed to digest starch. As a result, inulin passes through much of the digestive system intact. It is only in the colon that bacteria metabolise inulin, with the release of significant quantities of carbon dioxide and/or methane. Because inulin is not broken down into simple sugars (monosaccharides) by normal digestion, it does not elevate blood sugar levels, hence, helping diabetics regulate blood sugar levels."
DB00639,Butoconazole,CHEMBL1295,"The exact mechanism of the antifungal action of butoconazole is unknown, however, it is presumed to function as other imidazole derivatives via inhibition of steroid synthesis. Imidazoles generally inhibit the conversion of lanosterol to ergosterol via the inhibition of the enzyme cytochrome P450 14&alpha;-demethylase, resulting in a change in fungal cell membrane lipid composition. This structural change alters cell permeability and, ultimately, results in the osmotic disruption or growth inhibition of the fungal cell."
DB00640,Adenosine,CHEMBL477,"Adenosine slows conduction time through the AV node and can interrupt the reentry pathways through the AV node, resulting in the restoration of normal sinus rhythm in patients with paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT), including PSVT associated with Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome. This effect may be mediated through the drug's activation of cell-surface A<sub>1</sub> and A<sub>2</sub> adenosine receptors. Adenosine also inhibits the slow inward calcium current and activation of adenylate cyclase in smooth muscle cells, thereby causing relaxation of vascular smooth muscle. By increasing blood flow in normal coronary arteries with little or no increase in stenotic arteries (with little to no increase in stenotic arteries), adenosine produces a relative difference in thallous (thallium) chloride TI 201 uptake in myocardium supplied by normal verus stenotic coronary arteries."
DB00641,Simvastatin,CHEMBL1064,"Simvastatin is a prodrug in which the 6-membered lactone ring of simvastatin is hydrolyzed <i>in vivo</i> to generate the beta,delta-dihydroxy acid, an active metabolite structurally similar to HMG-CoA (hydroxymethylglutaryl CoA). Once hydrolyzed, simvastatin competes with HMG-CoA for HMG-CoA reductase, a hepatic microsomal enzyme. Interference with the activity of this enzyme reduces the quantity of mevalonic acid, a precursor of cholesterol."
DB00642,Pemetrexed,CHEMBL225072,"Pemetrexed is an antifolate containing the pyrrolopyrimidine-based nucleus that exerts its antineoplastic activity by disrupting folate-dependent metabolic processes essential for cell replication. In vitro studies have shown that pemetrexed inhibits thymidylate synthase (TS), dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), and glycinamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase (GARFT), all folate-dependent enzymes involved in the de novo biosynthesis of thymidine and purine nucleotides. Pemetrexed is transported into cells by both the reduced folate carrier and membrane folate binding protein transport systems. Once in the cell, pemetrexed is converted to polyglutamate forms by the enzyme folylpolyglutamate synthetase. The polyglutamate forms are retained in cells and are inhibitors of TS and GARFT. Polyglutamation is a time- and concentration-dependent process that occurs in tumor cells and, to a lesser extent, in normal tissues. Polyglutamated metabolites have an increased intracellular half-life resulting in prolonged drug action in malignant cells."
DB00643,Mebendazole,CHEMBL685,"Mebendazole causes degenerative alterations in the tegument and intestinal cells of the worm by binding to the colchicine-sensitive site of tubulin, thus inhibiting its polymerization or assembly into microtubules. The loss of the cytoplasmic microtubules leads to impaired uptake of glucose by the larval and adult stages of the susceptible parasites, and depletes their glycogen stores. Degenerative changes in the endoplasmic reticulum, the mitochondria of the germinal layer, and the subsequent release of lysosomes result in decreased production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is the energy required for the survival of the helminth. Due to diminished energy production, the parasite is immobilized and eventually dies."
DB00644,Gonadorelin,CHEMBL1981292,"Systemic - Like naturally occurring gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), gonadorelin primarily stimulates the synthesis and release of luteinizing hormone (LH) from the anterior pituitary gland. Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) production and release is also increased by gonadorelin, but to a lesser degree. In prepubertal females and some gonadal function disorders, the FSH response may be greater than the LH response. For the treatment of amenorrhea, delayed puberty, and infertility the administration of gonadorelin is used to simulate the physiologic release of GnRH from the hypothalamus in treatment of delayed puberty, treatment of infertility caused by hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, and induction of ovulation in those women with hypothalamic amenorrhea. This results in increased levels of pituitary gonadotropins LH and FSH, which subsequently stimulate the gonads to produce reproductive steroids."
DB00645,Dyclonine,CHEMBL1201217,"Local anesthetics block both the initiation and conduction of nerve impulses by decreasing the neuronal membrane's permeability to sodium ions. This reversibly stabilizes the membrane and inhibits depolarization, resulting in the failure of a propagated action potential and subsequent conduction blockade."
DB00646,Nystatin,CHEMBL229383,Nystatin exerts its antifungal activity by binding to ergosterol found in fungal cell membranes. Binding to ergosterol causes the formation of pores in the membrane. Potassium and other cellular constituents leak from the pores causing cell death. 
DB00647,Dextropropoxyphene,CHEMBL1213351,"Propoxyphene acts as a weak agonist at OP1, OP2, and OP3 opiate receptors within the central nervous system (CNS). Propoxyphene primarily affects OP3 receptors, which are coupled with G-protein receptors and function as modulators, both positive and negative, of synaptic transmission via G-proteins that activate effector proteins. Binding of the opiate stimulates the exchange of GTP for GDP on the G-protein complex. As the effector system is adenylate cyclase and cAMP located at the inner surface of the plasma membrane, opioids decrease intracellular cAMP by inhibiting adenylate cyclase. Subsequently, the release of nociceptive neurotransmitters such as substance P, GABA, dopamine, acetylcholine, and noradrenaline is inhibited. Opioids such as propoxyphene also inhibit the release of vasopressin, somatostatin, insulin, and glucagon. Opioids close N-type voltage-operated calcium channels (OP2-receptor agonist) and open calcium-dependent inwardly rectifying potassium channels (OP3 and OP1 receptor agonist). This results in hyperpolarization and reduced neuronal excitability."
DB00648,Mitotane,CHEMBL1670,"Its biochemical mechanism of action is unknown, although data are available to suggest that the drug modifies the peripheral metabolism of steroids as well as directly suppressing the adrenal cortex."
DB00649,Stavudine,CHEMBL991,Stavudine inhibits the activity of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) both by competing with the natural substrate dGTP and by its incorporation into viral DNA.
DB00650,Leucovorin,CHEMBL1679,"As leucovorin is a derivative of folic acid, it can be used to increase levels of folic acid under conditions favoring folic acid inhibition (following treatment of folic acid antagonists such as methotrexate). Leucovorin enhances the activity of fluorouracil by stabilizing the bond of the active metabolite (5-FdUMP) to the enzyme thymidylate synthetase."
DB00651,Dyphylline,CHEMBL1752,"The bronchodilatory action of dyphylline, as with other xanthines, is thought to be mediated through competitive inhibition of phosphodiesterase with a resulting increase in cyclic AMP producing relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle as well as antagonism of adenosine receptors."
DB00652,Pentazocine,CHEMBL560,"The preponderance of evidence suggests that pentazocine antagonizes the opioid effects by competing for the same receptor sites, especially the opioid mu receptor."
DB00653,Magnesium Sulfate,CHEMBL2021423,"Magnesium is the second most plentiful cation of the intracellular fluids. It is essential for the activity of many enzyme systems and plays an important role with regard to neurochemical transmission and muscular excitability. Magnesium sulfate reduces striated muscle contractions and blocks peripheral neuromuscular transmission by reducing acetylcholine release at the myoneural junction. Additionally, Magnesium inhibits Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through dihydropyridine-sensitive, voltage-dependent channels. This accounts for much of its relaxant action on vascular smooth muscle."
DB00654,Latanoprost,CHEMBL1051,"Latanoprost is a prostaglandin F2a analogue. Specifically, Latanoprost is a prostanoid selective FP receptor agonist that is believed to reduce the intraocular pressure (IOP) by increasing the outflow of aqueous humor. Studies in animals and man suggest that the main mechanism of action is increased uveoscleral outflow. Elevated IOP represents a major risk factor for glaucomatous field loss. The higher the level of IOP, the greater the likelihood of optic nerve damage and visual field loss."
DB00655,Estrone,CHEMBL1405,"Estrogens enter the cells of responsive tissues (e.g. female organs, breasts, hypothalamus, pituitary) where they interact with estrogen receptors. Hormone-bound estrogen receptors dimerize, translocate to the nucleus of cells and bind to estrogen response elements (ERE) of genes. Binding to ERE alters the transcription rate of affected genes. Estrogens increase the hepatic synthesis of sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), thyroid-binding globulin (TBG), and other serum proteins and suppress follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) release from the anterior pituitary."
DB00656,Trazodone,CHEMBL621,"Trazodone binds at 5-HT2 receptor, it acts as a serotonin agonist at high doses and a serotonin antagonist at low doses. Like fluoxetine, trazodone's antidepressant activity likely results from blockage of serotonin reuptake by inhibiting serotonin reuptake pump at the presynaptic neuronal membrane. If used for long time periods, postsynaptic neuronal receptor binding sites may also be affected. The sedative effect of trazodone is likely the result of alpha-adrenergic blocking action and modest histamine blockade at H1 receptor. It weakly blocks presynaptic alpha2-adrenergic receptors and strongly inhibits postsynaptic alpha1 receptors. Trazodone does not affect the reuptake of norepinephrine or dopamine within the CNS."
DB00657,Mecamylamine,CHEMBL267936,"Mecamylamine is a ganglionic blocker which prevents stimulation of postsynaptic receptors by acetylcholine released from presynaptic nerve endings. The hypotensive effect of Mecamylamine is attributed to reduction in sympathetic tone, vasodilation, and reduced cardiac output, and is primarily postural."
DB00658,Sevelamer,CHEMBL1201798,"Sevelamer prevents hyperphosphatemia by binding to dietary phosphate in the gut, preventing its absorption and thus decreasing serum parathyroid hormone levels."
DB00659,Acamprosate,CHEMBL1201293,"The mechanism of action of acamprosate in maintenance of alcohol abstinence is not completely understood. Chronic alcohol exposure is hypothesized to alter the normal balance between neuronal excitation and inhibition. <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> studies in animals have provided evidence to suggest acamprosate may interact with glutamate and GABA neurotransmitter systems centrally, and has led to the hypothesis that acamprosate restores this balance. It seems to inhibit NMDA receptors while activating GABA receptors."
DB00660,Metaxalone,CHEMBL1079604,"The mechanism of action of metaxalone in humans has not been established, but may be due to general central nervous system depression."
DB00661,Verapamil,CHEMBL6966,"Verapamil inhibits voltage-dependent calcium channels. Specifically, its effect on L-type calcium channels in the heart causes a reduction in ionotropy and chronotropy, thuis reducing heart rate and blood pressure. Verapamil's mechanism of effect in cluster headache is thought to be linked to its calcium-channel blocker effect, but which channel subtypes are involved is presently not known."
DB00662,Trimethobenzamide,CHEMBL1201256,"The mechanism of action of trimethobenzamide as determined in animals is obscure, but may involve the chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ), an area in the medulla oblongata through which emetic impulses are conveyed to the vomiting center; direct impulses to the vomiting center apparently are not similarly inhibited."
DB00663,Flumethasone,CHEMBL1201392,"Flumethasone is a glucocorticoid receptor agonist. This complex binds to the nucleus causing a variety of genetic activation and repressions. The antiinflammatory actions of corticosteroids are thought to involve lipocortins, phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins which, through inhibition arachidonic acid, control the biosynthesis of prostaglandins and leukotrienes. The immune system is suppressed by corticosteroids due to a decrease in the function of the lymphatic system, a reduction in immunoglobulin and complement concentrations, the precipitation of lymphocytopenia, and interference with antigen-antibody binding. Flumethasone binds to plasma transcortin, and it becomes active when it is not bound to transcortin."
DB00664,Sulfametopyrazine,CHEMBL1525826,"Sulfametopyrazine is a competitive inhibitor of the bacterial  enzyme dihydropteroate synthetase. Para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA), a substrate of the enzyme is prevented  from binding. The inhibited reaction is necessary in these organisms for the synthesis of folic acid."
DB00665,Nilutamide,CHEMBL1274,"Nilutamide competes with androgen for the binding of androgen receptors, consequently blocking the action of androgens of adrenal and testicular origin that stimulate the growth of normal and malignant prostatic tissue. This blockade of androgen receptors may result in growth arrest or transient tumor regression through inhibition of androgen-dependent DNA and protein synthesis."
DB00666,Nafarelin,CHEMBL1201309,"Like GnRH, initial or intermittent administration of nafarelin stimulates release of the gonadotropins luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) from the pituitary gland, which in turn transiently increases production of estradiol in females and testosterone in both sexes. However, with continuous daily administration, nafarelin continuously occupies the GnRH receptor, leading to a reversible down-regulation of the GnRH receptors in the pituitary gland and desensitization of the pituitary gonadotropes. This causes a significant and sustained decline in the production of LH and FSH. A decline in gonadotropin production and release causes a dramatic reversible decrease in synthesis of estradiol, progesterone, and testosterone by the ovaries or testes. Like normal endometrium, endometriotic implants contain estrogen receptors. Estrogen stimulates the growth of endometrium. Use of nafarelin induces anovulation and amenorrhea and decreases serum concentrations of estradiol to the postmenopausal range, which induces atrophy of endometriotic implants. However, nafarelin does not abolish the underlying pathophysiology of endometriosis. In children with central precocious puberty receiving nafarelin, serum LH, testosterone, and estradiol concentrations return to prepubertal levels. This results in the supression of secondary sexual characteristics and decrased rate of linear growth and skeletal maturation. Following disconinuation of nafarelin, the effects of the drug is reversed, meaning FSH and LH concentrations usually return to pretreatment levels."
DB00668,Epinephrine,CHEMBL679,"Epinephrine works via the stimulation of alpha and beta-1 adrenergic receptors, and a moderate activity at beta-2 adrenergic receptors."
DB00669,Sumatriptan,CHEMBL128,"The 5-HT<sub>1B</sub> and 5-HT<sub>1D</sub> receptors function as autoreceptors, which inhibit the firing of serotonin neurons and a reduction in the synthesis and release of serotonin upon activation. After sumatriptan binds to these receptors, adenylate cyclase activity is inhibited via regulatory G proteins, incrases intracellular calcium, and affects other intracellular events. This results in vasoconstriction and inhibtion of sensory nociceptive (trigeminal) nerve firing and vasoactive neuropeptide release."
DB00670,Pirenzepine,CHEMBL9967,"Pirenzepine is a muscarinic receptor antagonist and binds to the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor. The muscarinic acetylcholine receptor mediates various cellular responses, including inhibition of adenylate cyclase, breakdown of phosphoinositides and modulation of potassium channels through the action of G proteins."
DB00671,Cefixime,CHEMBL1541,"Like all beta-lactam antibiotics, cefixime binds to specific penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) located inside the bacterial cell wall, causing the inhibition of the third and last stage of bacterial cell wall synthesis. Cell lysis is then mediated by bacterial cell wall autolytic enzymes such as autolysins; it is possible that cefixime interferes with an autolysin inhibitor."
DB00672,Chlorpropamide,CHEMBL498,"Sulfonylureas such as chlorpropamide bind to ATP-sensitive potassium channels on the pancreatic cell surface, reducing potassium conductance and causing depolarization of the membrane. Depolarization stimulates calcium ion influx through voltage-sensitive calcium channels, raising intracellular concentrations of calcium ions, which induces the secretion, or exocytosis, of insulin."
DB00673,Aprepitant,CHEMBL1471,"Aprepitant has been shown in animal models to inhibit emesis induced by cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents, such as cisplatin, via central actions. Animal and human Positron Emission Tomography (PET) studies with Aprepitant have shown that it crosses the blood brain barrier and occupies brain NK1 receptors. Animal and human studies show that Aprepitant augments the antiemetic activity of the 5-HT<sub>3</sub>-receptor antagonist ondansetron and the corticosteroid
ethasone and inhibits both the acute and delayed phases of cisplatin induced emesis."
DB00674,Galantamine,CHEMBL659,"Galantamine is a phenanthrene alkaloid and a reversible, competitive acetylcholinesterase inhibitor. It is not structurally related to other acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. Galantamine's proposed mechanism of action involves the reversible inhibition of acetylcholinesterase, which prevents the hydrolysis of acetycholine, leading to an increased concentration of acetylcholine at cholinergic synapses. Galantamine also binds allosterically with nicotinic acetylcholine receptors and may possibly potentiate the action of agonists (such as acetylcholine) at these receptors."
DB00675,Tamoxifen,CHEMBL83,"Tamoxifen is a nonsteroidal agent that binds to estrogen receptors (ER), inducing a conformational change in the receptor. This results in a blockage or change in the expression of estrogen dependent genes. The prolonged binding of tamoxifen to the nuclear chromatin of these results in reduced DNA polymerase activity, impaired thymidine utilization, blockade of estradiol uptake, and decreased estrogen response. It is likely that tamoxifen interacts with other coactivators or corepressors in the tissue and binds with different estrogen receptors, ER-alpha or ER-beta, producing both estrogenic and antiestrogenic effects."
DB00676,Benzyl Benzoate,CHEMBL1239,"Benzyl benzoate exerts toxic effects on the nervous system of the parasite, resulting in its death. It is also toxic to mite ova, though its exact mechanism of action is unknown. In vitro, benzyl benzoate has been found to kill the Sarcoptes mite within 5 minutes."
DB00677,Isoflurophate,CHEMBL1025,The mechanism of isoflurophate's action involves the irreversible inhibition of cholinesterase.
DB00678,Losartan,CHEMBL191,"Losartan competitively inhibits the binding of angiotensin II to AT1 in many tissues including vascular smooth muscle and the adrenal glands. Losartan is metabolized to its active metabolite, E-3174, which is 10 to 40 times more potent than losartan and acts as a non-competitive AT1 antagonist. Inhibition of angiotensin II binding to AT1 inhibits its AT1-mediated vasoconstrictive and aldosterone-secreting effects and results in decreased vascular resistance and blood pressure. Losartan is 1,000 times more selective for AT1 than AT2. Inhibition of aldosterone secretion may increase sodium and water excretion while decreasing potassium excretion. Losartan is effective for reducing blood pressure and may be used to treat essential hypertension, left ventricular hypertrophy and diabetic nephropathy."
DB00679,Thioridazine,CHEMBL479,"Thioridazine blocks postsynaptic mesolimbic dopaminergic D1 and D2 receptors in the brain; blocks alpha-adrenergic effect, depresses the release of hypothalamic and hypophyseal hormones and is believed to depress the reticular activating system thus affecting basal metabolism, body temperature, wakefulness, vasomotor tone, and emesis."
DB00680,Moricizine,CHEMBL1075,Moricizine works by inhibiting the rapid inward sodium current across myocardial cell membranes.
DB00681,Amphotericin B,CHEMBL267345,"Amphotericin B is fungistatic or fungicidal depending on the concentration obtained in body fluids and the susceptibility of the fungus. The drug acts by binding to sterols (ergosterol) in the cell membrane of susceptible fungi. This creates a transmembrane channel, and the resultant change in membrane permeability allowing leakage of intracellular components. Ergosterol, the principal sterol in the fungal cytoplasmic membrane, is the target site of action of amphotericin B and the azoles. Amphotericin B, a polyene, binds irreversibly to ergosterol, resulting in disruption of membrane integrity and ultimately cell death."
DB00682,Warfarin,CHEMBL1464,"Warfarin inhibits vitamin K reductase, resulting in depletion of the reduced form of vitamin K (vitamin KH2). As vitamin K is a cofactor for the carboxylation of glutamate residues on the N-terminal regions of vitamin K-dependent proteins, this limits the gamma-carboxylation and subsequent activation of the vitamin K-dependent coagulant proteins. The synthesis of vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors II, VII, IX, and X and anticoagulant proteins C and S is inhibited. Depression of three of the four vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors (factors II, VII, and X) results in decreased prothrombin levels and a decrease in the amount of thrombin generated and bound to fibrin. This reduces the thrombogenicity of clots."
DB00683,Midazolam,CHEMBL655,"It is thought that the actions of benzodiazepines such as midazolam are mediated through the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), which is one of the major inhibitory neurotransmitters in the brain. Benzodiazepines increase the activity of GABA, thereby producing a calming effect, relaxing skeletal muscles, and inducing sleep. Benzodiazepines bind to the benzodiazepine site on GABA-A receptors, which potentiates the effects of GABA by increasing the frequency of chloride channel opening."
DB00684,Tobramycin,CHEMBL1747,"Tobramycin binds irreversibly to one of two aminoglycoside binding sites on the 30 S ribosomal subunit, inhibiting bacterial protein synthesis. Tobramycin may also destabilize bacterial memebrane by binding to 16 S 16 S r-RNA. An active transport mechanism for aminoglycoside uptake is necessary in the bacteria in order to attain a significant intracellular concentration of tobramycin."
DB00685,Trovafloxacin,CHEMBL428,"Trovafloxacin is a fluoronaphthyridone related to the fluoroquinolones with in vitro activity against a wide range of gram-negative and gram-positive aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms. The bactericidal action of trovafloxacin results from inhibition of DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV. DNA gyrase is an essential enzyme that is involved in the replication, transcription, and repair of bacterial DNA. Topoisomerase IV is an enzyme known to play a key role in the partitioning of the chromosomal DNA during bacterial cell division."
DB00686,Pentosan Polysulfate,,Pentosan polysulfate is a polymer of xylose hydrogen sulfate and contains two sulfate groups per carbohydrate monomer. It binds Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) as well as other heparin-binding growth factors. It has been shown to interact also with the heparin-binding site of FGFR-1. It inhibits the growth of SW13 adrenocortical cells transfected with FGF-4 and tumorigenicity of MCF-7 breast carcinoma cells transfected with FGF-1 or FGF-4.
DB00687,Fludrocortisone,CHEMBL1201388,Fludrocortisone binds the mineralocorticoid receptor (aldosterone receptor). This binding (or activation of the mineralocorticoid receptor by fludrocortisone) in turn causes an increase in ion and water transport and thus raises extracellular fluid volume and blood pressure and lowers potassium levels.
DB00688,Mycophenolate mofetil,CHEMBL1456,"Mycophenolate mofetil is hydrolyzed to form mycophenolic acid (MPA), which is the active metabolite. MPA is a potent, selective, uncompetitive, and reversible inhibitor of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH), and therefore inhibits the de novo pathway of guanosine nucleotide synthesis without incorporation into DNA. Because T- and B-lymphocytes are critically dependent for their proliferation on de novo synthesis of purines, whereas other cell types can utilize salvage pathways, MPA has potent cytostatic effects on lymphocytes. MPA inhibits proliferative responses of T- and B-lymphocytes to both mitogenic and allospecific stimulation. Addition of guanosine or deoxyguanosine reverses the cytostatic effects of MPA on lymphocytes. MPA also suppresses antibody formation by B-lymphocytes. MPA prevents the glycosylation of lymphocyte and monocyte glycoproteins that are involved in intercellular adhesion to endothelial cells and may inhibit recruitment of leukocytes into sites of inflammation and graft rejection. Mycophenolate mofetil did not inhibit early events in the activation of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, such as the production of interleukin-1 (IL-1) and interleukin-2 (IL-2), but did block the coupling of these events to DNA synthesis and proliferation."
DB00689,Cephaloglycin,CHEMBL1200971,The bactericidal activity of cephaloglycin results from the inhibition of cell wall synthesis via affinity for penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs).
DB00690,Flurazepam,CHEMBL968,"Flurazepam binds to an allosteric site on GABA-A receptors. Binding potentiates the action of GABA on GABA-A receptors by opening the chloride channel within the receptor, causing chloride influx and hyperpolarization."
DB00691,Moexipril,CHEMBL1165,"Moexipril is a prodrug for moexiprilat, which inhibits ACE in humans and animals. The mechanism through which moexiprilat lowers blood pressure is believed to be primarily inhibition of ACE activity. ACE is a peptidyl dipeptidase that catalyzes the conversion of the inactive decapeptide angiotensin I to the vasoconstrictor substance angiotensin II. Angiotensin II is a potent peripheral vasoconstrictor that also stimulates aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex and provides negative feedback on renin secretion. ACE is identical to kininase II, an enzyme that degrades bradykinin, an endothelium-dependent vasodilator. Moexiprilat is about 1000 times as potent as moexipril in inhibiting ACE and kininase II. Inhibition of ACE results in decreased angiotensin II formation, leading to decreased vasoconstriction, increased plasma renin activity, and decreased aldosterone secretion. The latter results in diuresis and natriuresis and a small increase in serum potassium concentration (mean increases of about 0.25 mEq/L were seen when moexipril was used alone). Whether increased levels of bradykinin, a potent vasodepressor peptide, play a role in the therapeutic effects of moexipril remains to be elucidated. Although the principal mechanism of moexipril in blood pressure reduction is believed to be through the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, ACE inhibitors have some effect on blood pressure even in apparent low-renin hypertension."
DB00692,Phentolamine,CHEMBL597,"Phentolamine produces its therapeutic actions by competitively blocking alpha-adrenergic receptors (primarily excitatory responses of smooth muscle and exocrine glands), leading to a muscle relaxation and a widening of the blood vessels. This widening of the blood vessels results in a lowering of blood pressure. The action of phentolamine on the alpha adrenergic receptors is relatively transient and the blocking effect is incomplete. The drug is more effective in antagonizing responses to circulating epinephrine and/or norepinephrine than in antagonizing responses to mediator released at the adrenergic nerve ending. Phentolamine also stimulates β-adrenergic receptors and produces a positive inotropic and chronotropic effect on the heart and increases cardiac output."
DB00693,Fluorescein,CHEMBL1057,"Fluorescein sodium is used extensively as a diagnostic tool in the field of ophthalmology. Fluorescein is a fluorescent compound or fluorophore having a maximum absorbance of 494 m and an emission maximum of 521 nm. The yellowish-green fluorescence of the compound  can be used to demarcate the vascular area under observation, distinguishing it from adjacent areas. It is applied topically in the form of a drop or it can be injected intravenously to produce a fluorescein angiogram. Topical fluorescein is a useful tool in the diagnosis of corneal abrasions, corneal ulcers, herpetic corneal infections, and dry eye. Fluorescein angiography is used to diagnose and categorize macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, inflammatory intraocular conditions, and intraocular tumors.

"
DB00694,Daunorubicin,CHEMBL178,"Daunorubicin has antimitotic and cytotoxic activity through a number of proposed mechanisms of action: Daunorubicin forms complexes with DNA by intercalation between base pairs, and it inhibits topoisomerase II activity by stabilizing the DNA-topoisomerase II complex, preventing the religation portion of the ligation-religation reaction that topoisomerase II catalyzes."
DB00695,Furosemide,CHEMBL35,"Furosemide, a loop diuretic, inhibits water reabsorption in the nephron by blocking the sodium-potassium-chloride cotransporter (NKCC2) in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle. This is achieved through competitive inhibition at the chloride binding site on the cotransporter, thus preventing the transport of sodium from the lumen of the loop of Henle into the basolateral interstitium. Consequently, the lumen becomes more hypertonic while the interstitium becomes less hypertonic, which in turn diminishes the osmotic gradient for water reabsorption throughout the nephron. Because the thick ascending limb is responsible for 25% of sodium reabsorption in the nephron, furosemide is a very potent diuretic."
DB00696,Ergotamine,CHEMBL442,"Ergotamine acts on migraine by one of two proposed mechanisms: 1) activation of 5-HT<sub>1D</sub> receptors located on intracranial blood vessels, including those on arterio-venous anastomoses, leads to vasoconstriction, which correlates with the relief of migraine headache, and 2) activation of 5-HT<sub>1D</sub> receptors on sensory nerve endings of the trigeminal system results in the inhibition of pro-inflammatory neuropeptide release."
DB00697,Tizanidine,CHEMBL1079,Tizanidine reduces spasticity by increasing presynaptic inhibition of motor neurons through agonist action at a2-adrenergic receptor sites.
DB00698,Nitrofurantoin,CHEMBL572,"Nitrofurantoin is activated by bacterial flavoproteins (nitrofuran reductase) to active reduced reactive intermediates that are thought to modulate and damage ribosomal proteins or other macromolecules, especially DNA, causing inhibition of DNA, RNA, protein, and cell wall synthesis. The overall effect is inhibition of bacterial growth or cell death. "
DB00699,Nicergoline,CHEMBL1372950,"Nicergoline acts by inhibiting the postsynaptic alpha(1)-adrenoceptors on vascular smooth muscle. This inhibits the vasoconstrictor effect of circulating and locally released catecholamines (epinephrine and norepinephrine), resulting in peripheral vasodilation. Therefore the mechanism of Nicergoline is to increase vascular circulation in the brain, thereby enhancing the transmission of nerve signals across the nerve fibres, which secrete acetylcholine as a neural transmitter."
DB00700,Eplerenone,CHEMBL1095097,"Eplerenone binds to the mineralocorticoid receptor and thereby blocks the binding of aldosterone (component of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system, or RAAS). Aldosterone synthesis, which occurs primarily in the adrenal gland, is modulated by multiple factors, including angiotensin II and non-RAAS mediators such as adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and potassium. Aldosterone binds to mineralocorticoid receptors in both epithelial (e.g., kidney) and nonepithelial (e.g., heart, blood vessels, and brain) tissues and increases blood pressure through induction of sodium reabsorption and possibly other mechanisms."
DB00701,Amprenavir,CHEMBL116,"Amprenavir inhibits the HIV viral proteinase enzyme which prevents cleavage of the gag-pol polyprotein, resulting in noninfectious, immature viral particles."
DB00702,Icodextrin,CHEMBL1201472,"Icodextrin is a starch-derived, water-soluble glucose polymer linked by alpha (1-4) and alpha (1-6) glycosidic bonds with an average molecular weight between 13,000 and 19,000 daltons. It functions as a colloid osmotic agent to achieve ultrafiltration during long (12-16 hour) peritoneal dialysis dwells. In other words it helps clean waste out of the body when the kidneys are not functioning properly. Icodectrin acts in the peritoneal cavity by exerting osmotic pressure across small intercellular pores resulting in transcapillary ultrafiltration through the dwell. This is due to the fact that the polymer is minimially absorbed across the peritoneal membrane. Icodextrin achieves superior fluid removal compared with glucose-based dialysates."
DB00703,Methazolamide,CHEMBL1335656,"Methazolamide is a potent inhibitor of carbonic anhydrase. Inhibition of carbonic anhydrase in the ciliary processes of the eye decreases aqueous humor secretion, presumably by slowing the formation of bicarbonate ions with subsequent reduction in sodium and fluid transport."
DB00704,Naltrexone,CHEMBL19019,"Naltrexone is a pure opiate antagonist and has little or no agonist activity. The mechanism of action of naltrexone in alcoholism is not understood; however, involvement of the endogenous opioid system is suggested by preclinical data. Naltrexone is thought to act as a competitive antagonist at mc, κ, and δ receptors in the CNS, with the highest affintiy for the μ receptor. Naltrexone competitively binds to such receptors and may block the effects of endogenous opioids. This leads to the antagonization of most of the subjective and objective effects of opiates, including respiratory depression, miosis, euphoria, and drug craving. The major metabolite of naltrexone, 6-β-naltrexol, is also an opiate antagonist and may contribute to the antagonistic activity of the drug."
DB00705,Delavirdine,CHEMBL593,Delavirdine binds directly to viral reverse transcriptase (RT) and blocks the RNA-dependent and DNA-dependent DNA polymerase activities by disrupting the enzyme's catalytic site.
DB00706,Tamsulosin,CHEMBL836,"Tamsulosin is a selective antagonist at alpha-1A and alpha-1B-adrenoceptors in the prostate, prostatic capsule, prostatic urethra, and bladder neck. At least three discrete alpha1-adrenoceptor subtypes have been identified: alpha-1A, alpha-1B and alpha-1D; their distribution differs between human organs and tissue. Approximately 70% of the alpha1-receptors in human prostate are of the alpha-1A subtype. Blockage of these receptors causes relaxation of smooth muscles in the bladder neck and prostate, and thus decreases urinary outflow resistance in men."
DB00707,Porfimer sodium,,Cellular damage caused by porfimer is a consequence of the propagation of radical reactions. Radical initiation may occur after porfimer absorbs light to form a porphyrin excited state. Spin transfer from porfimer to molecular oxygen may then generate singlet oxygen. Subsequent radical reactions can form superoxide and hydroxyl radicals. Tumor death also occurs through ischemic necrosis secondary to vascular occlusion that appears to be partly mediated by thromboxane A2 release.
DB00708,Sufentanil,CHEMBL658,"Opiate receptors are coupled with G-protein receptors and function as both positive and negative regulators of synaptic transmission via G-proteins that activate effector proteins. Binding of the opiate stimulates the exchange of GTP for GDP on the G-protein complex. As the effector system is adenylate cyclase and cAMP located at the inner surface of the plasma membrane, opioids decrease intracellular cAMP by inhibiting adenylate cyclase. Subsequently, the release of nociceptive neurotransmitters such as substance P, GABA, dopamine, acetylcholine and noradrenaline is inhibited. Opioids also inhibit the release of vasopressin, somatostatin, insulin and glucagon. Sufentanil's analgesic activity is, most likely, due to its conversion to morphine. Opioids open calcium-dependent inwardly rectifying potassium channels (OP1 receptor agonist). This results in hyperpolarization and reduced neuronal excitability."
DB00709,Lamivudine,CHEMBL141,"Lamivudine is a synthetic nucleoside analogue and is phosphorylated intracellularly to its active 5'-triphosphate metabolite, lamivudine triphosphate (L-TP). This nucleoside analogue is incorporated into viral DNA by HIV reverse transcriptase and HBV polymerase, resulting in DNA chain termination."
DB00710,Ibandronate,CHEMBL997,"The action of ibandronate on bone tissue is based partly on its affinity for hydroxyapatite, which is part of the mineral matrix of bone. Nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates (such as pamidronate, alendronate, risedronate, ibandronate and zoledronate) appear to act as analogues of isoprenoid diphosphate lipids, thereby inhibiting farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) synthase, an enzyme in the mevalonate pathway. Inhibition of this enzyme in osteoclasts prevents the biosynthesis of isoprenoid lipids (FPP and GGPP) that are essential for the post-translational farnesylation and geranylgeranylation of small GTPase signalling proteins. This activity inhibits osteoclast activity and reduces bone resorption and turnover. In postmenopausal women, it reduces the elevated rate of bone turnover, leading to, on average, a net gain in bone mass."
DB00711,Diethylcarbamazine,CHEMBL684,"The mechanism of action of diethylcarbamazine is thought to involve sensitizing the microfilariae to phagocytosis. One study showed that diethylcarbamazine's activity against <i>Brugia malayi</i> microfilariae is dependent on inducible nitric-oxide synthase and the cyclooxygenase pathway. It confirmed the important role of the arachidonic acid metabolic pathway in diethylcarbamazine's mechanism of action <i>in vivo</i> and showes that in addition to its effects on the 5-lipoxygenase pathway, it targets the cyclooxygenase pathway and COX-1."
DB00712,Flurbiprofen,CHEMBL563,"Similar to other NSAIAs, the anti-inflammatory effect of flurbiprofen occurs via reversible inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX), the enzyme responsible for the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandin G2 (PGG2) and PGG2 to prostaglandin H2 (PGH2) in the prostaglandin synthesis pathway. This effectively decreases the concentration of prostaglandins involved in inflammation, pain, swelling and fever. Flurbiprofen is a non-selective COX inhibitor and inhibits the activity of both COX-1 and -2. It is also one of the most potent NSAIAs in terms of prostaglandin inhibitory activity."
DB00713,Oxacillin,CHEMBL819,"By binding to specific penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) located inside the bacterial cell wall, Oxacillin inhibits the third and last stage of bacterial cell wall synthesis. Cell lysis is then mediated by bacterial cell wall autolytic enzymes such as autolysins; it is possible that Oxacillin interferes with an autolysin inhibitor."
DB00714,Apomorphine,CHEMBL53,"The precise mechanism of action of apomorphine as a treatment for Parkinson's disease is unknown, although it is believed to be due to stimulation of post-synaptic dopamine D2-type receptors within the brain. Apomorphine has been shown to improve motor function in an animal model of Parkinson's disease. In particular, apomorphine attenuates the motor deficits induced by lesions in the ascending nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathway with the neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) in primates."
DB00715,Paroxetine,CHEMBL490,"Paroxetine is a potent and highly selective inhibitor of neuronal serotonin reuptake. Paroxetine likely inhibits the reuptake of serotonin at the neuronal membrane, enhances serotonergic neurotransmission by reducing turnover of the neurotransmitter, therefore it prolongs its activity at synaptic receptor sites and potentiates 5-HT in the CNS; paroxetine is more potent than both sertraline and fluoxetine in its ability to inhibit 5-HT reuptake. Compared to the tricyclic antidepressants, SSRIs have dramatically decreased binding to histamine, acetylcholine, and norepinephrine receptors. The mechanism of action for the treatment of vasomotor symptoms is unknown. "
DB00716,Nedocromil,CHEMBL746,"Nedocromil has been shown to inhibit the in vitro activation of, and mediator release from, a variety of inflammatory cell types associated with asthma, including eosinophils, neutrophils, macrophages, mast cells, monocytes, and platelets. Nedocromil inhibits activation and release of inflammatory mediators such as histamine, prostaglandin D2 and leukotrienes c4 from different types of cells in the lumen and mucosa of the bronchial tree. These mediators are derived from arachidonic acid metabolism through the lipoxygenase and cyclo-oxygenase pathways. The mechanism of action of nedocromil may be due partly to inhibition of axon reflexes and release of sensory neuropeptides, such as substance P, neurokinin A, and calcitonin-gene&ntilde;related peptides. The result is inhibition of bradykinin-induced bronchoconstriction. Nedocromil does not posess any bronchodilator, antihistamine, or corticosteroid activity."
DB00717,Norethisterone,CHEMBL1162,"Progestins diffuse freely into target cells and bind to the progesterone receptor. Target cells include the female reproductive tract, the mammary gland, the hypothalamus, and the pituitary. Once bound to the receptor, progestins slow the frequency of release of gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) from the hypothalamus and blunt the pre-ovulatory LH surge."
DB00718,Adefovir Dipivoxil,CHEMBL922,"Adefovir dipivoxil is a prodrug of adefovir. Adefovir is an acyclic nucleotide analog of adenosine monophosphate which is phosphorylated to the active metabolite adefovir diphosphate by cellular kinases. Adefovir diphosphate inhibits HBV DNA polymerase (reverse transcriptase) by competing with the natural substrate deoxyadenosine triphosphate and by causing DNA chain termination after its incorporation into viral DNA. The inhibition constant (Ki) for adefovir diphosphate for HBV DNA polymerase was 0.1 &mu;M. Adefovir diphosphate is a weak inhibitor of human DNA polymerases &alpha; and &gamma; with Ki values of 1.18 &mu;M and 0.97&mu;M, respectively."
DB00719,Azatadine,CHEMBL946,Antihistamines such as azatadine appear to compete with histamine for histamine H1- receptor sites on effector cells. The antihistamines antagonize those pharmacological effects of histamine which are mediated through activation of H1- receptor sites and thereby reduce the intensity of allergic reactions and tissue injury response involving histamine release.
DB00720,Clodronic Acid,CHEMBL12318,"The bisphosphonate group binds strongly to the bone mineral, hydroxyapatite. This explains the specific pharmacological action of these compounds on mineralized tissues, especially bone. The exact mechanism of action of clodronate is not known, however it is known that it does not inhibit protein isoprenylation but can be metabolized intracellularly to a &beta;-&gamma;-methylene (AppCp-type) analog of ATP (AppCCl2p), which is cytotoxic to macrophages in vitro. Inhibition of the ADP/ATP translocase by the metabolite AppCCl2p is a likely route by which clodronate causes osteoclast apoptosis and inhibits bone resorption. Recently, the slime mold <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i> was shown to take up bisphosphonates by pinocytosis. In these cells, clodronate, but not other pharmacologically active bisphosphonates, was incorporated into adenine nucleotides, which could potentially explain why this bisphosphonate sometimes seems to act differently than the other bisphosphonates. Clodronate, like all biphosphonates, also binds protein-tyrosine-phosphatase."
DB00721,Procaine,CHEMBL569,"Procaine acts mainly by inhibiting sodium influx through voltage gated sodium channels in the neuronal cell membrane of peripheral nerves. When the influx of sodium is interrupted, an action potential cannot arise and signal conduction is thus inhibited. The receptor site is thought to be located at the cytoplasmic (inner) portion of the sodium channel. Procaine has also been shown to bind or antagonize the function of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors as well as nicotinic acetylcholine receptors and the serotonin receptor-ion channel complex."
DB00722,Lisinopril,CHEMBL1237,"There are two isoforms of ACE: the somatic isoform, which exists as a glycoprotein comprised of a single polypeptide chain of 1277; and the testicular isoform, which has a lower molecular mass and is thought to play a role in sperm maturation and binding of sperm to the oviduct epithelium. Somatic ACE has two functionally active domains, N and C, which arise from tandem gene duplication. Although the two domains have high sequence similarity, they play distinct physiological roles. The C-domain is predominantly involved in blood pressure regulation while the N-domain plays a role in hematopoietic stem cell differentiation and proliferation. ACE inhibitors bind to and inhibit the activity of both domains, but have much greater affinity for and inhibitory activity against the C-domain. Lisinopril, one of the few ACE inhibitors that is not a prodrug, competes with ATI for binding to ACE and inhibits and enzymatic proteolysis of ATI to ATII. Decreasing ATII levels in the body decreases blood pressure by inhibiting the pressor effects of ATII as described in the Pharmacology section above. Lisinopril also causes an increase in plasma renin activity likely due to a loss of feedback inhibition mediated by ATII on the release of renin and/or stimulation of reflex mechanisms via baroreceptors. "
DB00723,Methoxamine,CHEMBL524,"Methoxamine acts through peripheral vasoconstriction by acting as a pure alpha-1 adrenergic receptor agonist, consequently increasing systemic blood pressure (both systolic and diastolic)."
DB00724,Imiquimod,CHEMBL1282,"Imiquimod's mechanism of action is via stimulation of innate and acquired immune responses, which ultimately leads to inflammatory cell infiltration within the field of drug application followed by apoptosis of diseased tissue. Imiquimod does not have direct antiviral activity. Studies of mice show that imiquimod may induce cytokines, including interferon-alpha (IFNA) as well as several IFNA genes (IFNA1, IFNA2, IFNA5, IFNA6, and IFNA8) as well as the IFNB gene. Imiquimod also induced the expression of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor alpha genes. In the treatment of basal cell carcinoma, Imiquimod appears to act as a toll-like receptor-7 agonist, and is thought to exert its anti-tumor effect via modification of the immune response and stimulation of apoptosis in BCC cells. In treating basal cell carcinoma it may increase the infiltration of lymphocytes, dendritic cells, and macrophages into the tumor lesion."
DB00725,Homatropine Methylbromide,CHEMBL1200851,"Homatropine is a quaternary ammonium muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist. The muscarinic acetylcholine receptor mediates various cellular responses, including inhibition of adenylate cyclase, breakdown of phosphoinositides and modulation of potassium channels through the action of G proteins. Homatropine methylbromide inhibits the muscarinic actions of acetylcholine on structures innervated by postganglionic cholinergic nerves as well as on smooth muscles that respond to acetylcholine but lack cholinergic innervation. These postganglionic receptor sites are present in the autonomic effector cells of the smooth muscle, cardiac muscle, sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes, and exocrine glands. Depending on the dose, anticholinergics may reduce the motility and secretory activity of the gastrointestinal system, and the tone of the ureter and urinary bladder and may have a slight relaxant action on the bile ducts and gallbladder."
DB00726,Trimipramine,CHEMBL644,Trimipramine's mechanism of action differs from other tricyclic antidepressants. Trimipramine acts by decreasing the reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin (5-HT).
DB00727,Nitroglycerin,CHEMBL730,"Similar to other nitrites and organic nitrates, nitroglycerin is converted to nitric oxide (NO), an active intermediate compound which activates the enzyme guanylate cyclase. This stimulates the synthesis of cyclic guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cGMP) which then activates a series of protein kinase-dependent phosphorylations in the smooth muscle cells, eventually resulting in the dephosphorylation of the myosin light chain of the smooth muscle fiber. The subsequent release of calcium ions results in the relaxation of the smooth muscle cells and vasodilation."
DB00728,Rocuronium,CHEMBL1201244,"Rocuronium acts by competing for cholinergic receptors at the motor end-plate. This action is antagonized by acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, such as neostigmine and edrophonium. Rocuronium acts by competitively binding to nicotinic cholinergic receptors. The binding of vecuronium decreases the opportunity for acetylcholine to bind to the nicotinic receptor at the postjunctional membrane of the myoneural junction. As a result, depolarization is prevented, calcium ions are not released and muscle contraction does not occur. Evidence also suggests that nondepolarizing agents can affect ACh release. It has been hypothesized that nondepolarzing agents bind to postjunctional (""curare"") receptors and may therefore interfere with the sodium and potassium flux, which is responsible for depolarization and repolarization of the membranes involved in muscle contraction. "
DB00729,Diphemanil Methylsulfate,CHEMBL1200880,"Diphemanil Methylsulfate exerts its action by primarily binding the muscarinic M3 receptor. M3 receptors are located in the smooth muscles of the blood vessels, as well as in the lungs. This means they cause vasodilation and bronchoconstriction. They are also in the smooth muscles of the gastrointestinal tract (GIT), which help in increasing intestinal motility and dilating sphincters. The M3 receptors are also located in many glands which help to stimulate secretion in salivary glands and other glands of the body."
DB00730,Thiabendazole,CHEMBL625,"The precise mode of action of thiabendazole on the parasite is unknown, but it most likely inhibits the helminth-specific enzyme fumarate reductase."
DB00731,Nateglinide,CHEMBL783,"Nateglinide activity is dependent on the presence functioning β cells and glucose. In contrast to sulfonylurea insulin secretatogogues, nateglinide has no effect on insulin release in the absence of glucose. Rather, it potentiates the effect of extracellular glucose on ATP-sensitive potassium channel and has little effect on insulin levels between meals and overnight. As such, nateglinide is more effective at reducing postprandial blood glucose levels than fasting blood glucose levels and requires a longer duration of therapy (approximately one month) before decreases in fasting blood glucose are observed. The insulinotropic effects of nateglinide are highest at intermediate glucose levels (3 to 10 mmol/L) and it does not increase insulin release already stimulated by high glucose concentrations (greater than 15 mmol/L). Nateglinide appears to be selective for pancreatic β cells and does not appear to affect skeletal or cardiac muscle or thyroid tissue."
DB00732,Atracurium besylate,CHEMBL1200527,"Atracurium antagonizes the neurotransmitter action of acetylcholine by binding competitively with cholinergic receptor sites on the motor end-plate. This antagonism is inhibited, and neuromuscular block reversed, by acetylcholinesterase inhibitors such as neostigmine, edrophonium, and pyridostigmine."
DB00733,Pralidoxime,CHEMBL1420,"Pralidoxime is an antidote to organophosphate pesticides and chemicals. Organophosphates bind to the esteratic site of acetylcholinesterase, which results initially in reversible inactivation of the enzyme. Acetylcholinesterase inhibition causes acetylcholine to accumulate in synapses, producing continuous stimulation of cholinergic fibers throughout the nervous systems. If given within 24 hours after organophosphate exposure, pralidoxime reactivates the acetylcholinesterase by cleaving the phosphate-ester bond formed between the organophosphate and acetylcholinesterase."
DB00734,Risperidone,CHEMBL85,"Blockade of dopaminergic D2 receptors in the limbic system alleviates positive symptoms of schizophrenia such as hallucinations, delusions, and erratic behavior and speech. Blockade of serotonergic 5-HT<sub>2</sub> receptors in the mesocortical tract, causes an excess of dopamine and an increase in dopamine transmission, resulting in an increase in dopamine transmission and an elimination of core negative symptoms. Dopamine receptors in the nigrostriatal pathway are not affected by risperidone and extrapyramidal effects are avoided. Like other 5-HT<sub>2</sub> antagonists, risperidone also binds at alpha(1)-adrenergic receptors and, to a lesser extent, at histamine H1 and alpha(2)-adrenergic receptors."
DB00735,Naftifine,CHEMBL626,"Although the exact mechanism of action against fungi is not known, naftifine appears to interfere with sterol biosynthesis by inhibiting the enzyme squalene 2,3-epoxidase. This inhibition of enzyme activity results in decreased amounts of sterols, especially ergosterol, and a corresponding accumulation of squalene in the cells."
DB00736,Esomeprazole,CHEMBL1201320,"Esomeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor that suppresses gastric acid secretion by specific inhibition of the H<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase in the gastric parietal cell. By acting specifically on the proton pump, Esomeprazole blocks the final step in acid production, thus reducing gastric acidity."
DB00737,Meclizine,CHEMBL1623,"Along with its actions as an antagonist at H<sub>1</sub>-receptors, meclizine also possesses anticholinergic, central nervous system depressant, and local anesthetic effects. Meclizine depresses labyrinth excitability and vestibular stimulation and may affect the medullary chemoreceptor trigger zone."
DB00738,Pentamidine,CHEMBL55,"The mode of action of pentamidine is not fully understood. It is thought that the drug interferes with nuclear metabolism producing inhibition of the synthesis of DNA, RNA, phospholipids, and proteins."
DB00739,Hetacillin,CHEMBL1201116,"Hetacillin is a semisynthetic penicillin prodrug which itself has no antibacterial activity, but is converted in the body to ampicillin and has actions and uses similar to those of ampicillin. Hetacillin is prepared by reacting ampicillin with acetone. Ampicillin rapidly decomposes because of the intramolecular attack of the side chain amino group on the lactam ring. Hetacillin locks up the offending amino group and prevents the decompolsition Hetacillin, once hydrolyzed to ampicillin (and acetone) binds to the penicillin binding proteins found in susceptible bacteria. This inhibits the third and last stage of bacterial cell wall synthesis. Cell lysis is then mediated by bacterial cell wall autolytic enzymes such as autolysins. Targets below reflect ampicillin targets. "
DB00740,Riluzole,CHEMBL744,"The mode of action of riluzole is unknown. Its pharmacological properties include the following, some of which may be related to its effect: 1) an inhibitory effect on glutamate release (activation of glutamate reuptake), 2) inactivation of voltage-dependent sodium channels, and 3) ability to interfere with intracellular events that follow transmitter binding at excitatory amino acid receptors."
DB00741,Hydrocortisone,CHEMBL389621,"Hydrocortisone binds to the cytosolic glucocorticoid receptor. After binding the receptor the newly formed receptor-ligand complex translocates itself into the cell nucleus, where it binds to many glucocorticoid response elements (GRE) in the promoter region of the target genes. The DNA bound receptor then interacts with basic transcription factors, causing the increase in expression of specific target genes. The anti-inflammatory actions of corticosteroids are thought to involve lipocortins, phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins which, through inhibition arachidonic acid, control the biosynthesis of prostaglandins and leukotrienes. Specifically glucocorticoids induce lipocortin-1 (annexin-1) synthesis, which then binds to cell membranes preventing the phospholipase A2 from coming into contact with its substrate arachidonic acid. This leads to diminished eicosanoid production. The cyclooxygenase (both COX-1 and COX-2) expression is also suppressed, potentiating the effect. In other words, the two main products in inflammation Prostaglandins and Leukotrienes are inhibited by the action of Glucocorticoids. Glucocorticoids also stimulate the lipocortin-1 escaping to the extracellular space, where it binds to the leukocyte membrane receptors and inhibits various inflammatory events: epithelial adhesion, emigration, chemotaxis, phagocytosis, respiratory burst and the release of various inflammatory mediators (lysosomal enzymes, cytokines, tissue plasminogen activator, chemokines etc.) from neutrophils, macrophages and mastocytes. Additionally the immune system is suppressed by corticosteroids due to a decrease in the function of the lymphatic system, a reduction in immunoglobulin and complement concentrations, the precipitation of lymphocytopenia, and interference with antigen-antibody binding."
DB00742,Mannitol,CHEMBL689,"Mannitol is an osmotic diuretic that is metabolically inert in humans and occurs naturally, as a sugar or sugar alcohol, in fruits and vegetables. Mannitol elevates blood plasma osmolality, resulting in enhanced flow of water from tissues, including the brain and cerebrospinal fluid, into interstitial fluid and plasma. As a result, cerebral edema, elevated intracranial pressure, and cerebrospinal fluid volume and pressure may be reduced. As a diurectic mannitol induces diuresis because it is not reabsorbed in the renal tubule, thereby increasing the osmolality of the glomerular filtrate, facilitating excretion of water, and inhibiting the renal tubular reabsorption of sodium, chloride, and other solutes. Mannitol promotes the urinary excretion of toxic materials and protects against nephrotoxicity by preventing the concentration of toxic substances in the tubular fluid. As an Antiglaucoma agent mannitol levates blood plasma osmolarity, resulting in enhanced flow of water from the eye into plasma and a consequent reduction in intraocular pressure. As a renal function diagnostic aid mannitol is freely filtered by the glomeruli with less than 10% tubular reabsorption. Therefore, its urinary excretion rate may serve as a measurement of glomerular filtration rate (GFR)."
DB00743,Gadobenic acid,CHEMBL1200571,"Based on the behavior of protons when placed in a strong magnetic field, which is interpreted and transformed into images by magnetic resonance (MR) instruments. Paramagnetic agents have unpaired electrons that generate a magnetic field about 700 times larger than the proton's field, thus disturbing the proton's local magnetic field. When the local magnetic field around a proton is disturbed, its relaxation process is altered. MR images are based on proton density and proton relaxation dynamics. MR instruments can record 2 different relaxation processes, the T1 (spin-lattice or longitudinal relaxation time) and the T2 (spin-spin or transverse relaxation time). In magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), visualization of normal and pathological brain tissue depends in part on variations in the radiofrequency signal intensity that occur with changes in proton density, alteration of the T1, and variation in the T2. When placed in a magnetic field, Gadobenate Dimeglumine shortens both the T1 and the T2 relaxation times in tissues where it accumulates. At clinical doses, Gadobenate Dimeglumine primarily affects the T1 relaxation time, thus producing an increase in signal intensity. Gadobenate Dimeglumine does not cross the intact blood-brain barrier; therefore, it does not accumulate in normal brain tissue or in central nervous system (CNS) lesions that have not caused an abnormal blood-brain barrier (e.g., cysts, mature post-operative scars)."
DB00744,Zileuton,CHEMBL93,"Leukotrienes are substances that induce numerous biological effects including augmentation of neutrophil and eosinophil migration, neutrophil and monocyte aggregation, leukocyte adhesion, increased capillary permeability, and smooth muscle contraction. These effects contribute to inflammation, edema, mucus secretion, and bronchoconstriction in the airways of asthmatic patients. Zileuton relieves such symptoms through its selective inhibition of 5-lipoxygenase, the enzyme that catalyzes the formation of leukotrienes from arachidonic acid. Specifically, it inhibits leukotriene LTB4, LTC4, LTD4, and LTE4 formation. Both the R(+) and S(-) enantiomers are pharmacologically active as 5-lipoxygenase inhibitors in <i>in vitro</i> systems. Due to the role of leukotrienes in the pathogenesis of asthma, modulation of leukotriene formation by interruption of 5-lipoxygenase activity may reduce airway symptoms, decrease bronchial smooth muscle tone, and improve asthma control."
DB00745,Modafinil,CHEMBL1373,"The exact mechanism of action is unclear, although <i>in vitro</i> studies have shown it to inhibit the reuptake of dopamine by binding to the dopamine reuptake pump, and lead to an increase in extracellular dopamine. Modafinil activates glutamatergic circuits while inhibiting GABA. Modafinil is thought to have less potential for abuse than other stimulants due to the absence of any significant euphoric or pleasurable effects. It is possible that modafinil acts by a synergistic combination of mechanisms including direct inhibition of dopamine reuptake, indirect inhibition of noradrenalin reuptake in the VLPO and orexin activation. Modafinil has partial alpha 1B-adrenergic agonist effects by directly stimulating the receptors."
DB00746,Deferoxamine,CHEMBL556,"Deferoxamine works in treating iron toxicity by binding trivalent (ferric) iron (for which it has a strong affinity), forming ferrioxamine, a stable complex which is eliminated via the kidneys. 100 mg of deferoxamine is capable of binding approximately 8.5 mg of trivalent (ferric) iron. Deferoxamine works in treating aluminum toxicity by binding to tissue-bound aluminum to form aluminoxamine, a stable, water-soluble complex. The formation of aluminoxamine increases blood concentrations of aluminum, resulting in an increased concentration gradient between the blood and dialysate, boosting the removal of aluminum during dialysis. 100 mg of deferoxamine is capable of binding approximately 4.1 mg of aluminum."
DB00747,Scopolamine,CHEMBL569713,Scopolamine acts by interfering with the transmission of nerve impulses by acetylcholine in the parasympathetic nervous system (specifically the vomiting center).
DB00748,Carbinoxamine,CHEMBL864,"Carbinoxamine competes with free histamine for binding at HA-receptor sites. This antagonizes the effects of histamine on HA-receptors, leading to a reduction of the negative symptoms brought on by histamine HA-receptor binding. Carbinoxamine's anticholinergic action appears to be due to a central antimuscarinic effect, which also may be responsible for its antiemetic effects, although the exact mechanism is unknown."
DB00749,Etodolac,CHEMBL622,"Similar to other NSAIDs, the anti-inflammatory effects of etodolac result from inhibition of the enzyme cycooxygenase (COX). This decreases the synthesis of peripheral prostaglandins involved in mediating inflammation. Etodolac binds to the upper portion of the COX enzyme active site and prevents its substrate, arachidonic acid, from entering the active site. Etodolac was previously thought to be a non-selective COX inhibitor, but it is now known to be 5 – 50 times more selective for COX-2 than COX-1. Antipyresis may occur by central action on the hypothalamus, resulting in peripheral dilation, increased cutaneous blood flow, and subsequent heat loss."
DB00750,Prilocaine,CHEMBL1194,"Prilocaine acts on sodium channels on the neuronal cell membrane, limiting the spread of seizure activity and reducing seizure propagation. The antiarrhythmic actions are mediated through effects on sodium channels in Purkinje fibers."
DB00751,Epinastine,CHEMBL1106,"Epinastine has a multiaction effect that inhibits the allergic response in 3 ways: 1. stabilizes mast cells by preventing mast cell degranulation to control the allergic response, 2. prevents histamine binding to both the H1- and H<sub>2</sub>-receptors to stop itching and provide lasting protection, and 3. prevents the release of proinflammatory chemical mediators from the blood vessel to halt progression of the allergic response."
DB00752,Tranylcypromine,CHEMBL313833,"Tranylcypromine irreversibly and nonselectively inhibits monoamine oxidase (MAO). Within neurons, MAO appears to regulate the levels of monoamines released upon synaptic firing. Since depression is associated with low levels of monoamines, the inhibition of MAO serves to ease depressive symptoms, as this results in an increase in the concentrations of these amines within the CNS."
DB00753,Isoflurane,CHEMBL1256,"Isoflurane induces a reduction in junctional conductance by decreasing gap junction channel opening times and increasing gap junction channel closing times. Isoflurane also activates calcium dependent ATPase in the sarcoplasmic reticulum by increasing the fluidity of the lipid membrane. Also appears to bind the D subunit of ATP synthase and NADH dehydogenase. Isoflurane also binds to the GABA receptor, the large conductance Ca<sup>2+</sup> activated potassium channel, the glutamate receptor and the glycine receptor."
DB00754,Ethotoin,CHEMBL1095,"The mechanism of action is probably very similar to that of phenytoin. The latter drug appears to stabilize rather than to raise the normal seizure threshold, and to prevent the spread of seizure activity rather than to abolish the primary focus of seizure discharges. Ethotoin inhibits nerve impulses in the motor cortex by lowering sodium ion influx, limiting tetanic stimulation."
DB00755,Tretinoin,CHEMBL38,"Tretinoin binds to alpha, beta, and gamma retinoic acid receptors (RARs). RAR-alpha and RAR-beta have been associated with the development of acute promyelocytic leukemia and squamous cell cancers, respectively. RAR-gamma is associated with retinoid effects on mucocutaneous tissues and bone. Although the exact mechanism of action of tretinoin is unknown, current evidence suggests that the effectiveness of tretinoin in acne is due primarily to its ability to modify abnormal follicular keratinization. Comedones form in follicles with an excess of keratinized epithelial cells. Tretinoin promotes detachment of cornified cells and the enhanced shedding of corneocytes from the follicle. By increasing the mitotic activity of follicular epithelia, tretinoin also increases the turnover rate of thin, loosely-adherent corneocytes. Through these actions, the comedo contents are extruded and the formation of the microcomedo, the precursor lesion of acne vulgaris, is reduced. Tretinoin is not a cytolytic agent but instead induces cytodifferentiation and decreased proliferation of APL cells in culture and in vivo. When Tretinoin is given systemically to APL patients, tretinoin treatment produces an initial maturation of the primitive promyelocytes derived from the leukemic clone, followed by a repopulation of the bone marrow and peripheral blood by normal, polyclonal hematopoietic cells in patients achieving complete remission (CR). The exact mechanism of action of tretinoin in APL is unknown."
DB00756,Hexachlorophene,CHEMBL496,"The primary mechanism of action of hexachlorophene, based on studies with <i>Bacillus megatherium</i>, is to inhibit the membrane-bound part of the electron transport chain, respiratory D-lactate dehydrogenase. It induces leakage, causes protoplast lysis, and inhibits respiration."
DB00757,Dolasetron,CHEMBL2368925,"Dolasetron is a selective serotonin 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor antagonist. In vivo, the drug is rapidly converted into its major active metabolite, hydrodolasetron, which seems to be largely responsible for the drug's pharmacological activity. The antiemetic activity of the drug is brought about through the inhibition of 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptors present both centrally (medullary chemoreceptor zone) and peripherally (GI tract). This inhibition of 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptors in turn inhibits the visceral afferent stimulation of the vomiting center, likely indirectly at the level of the area postrema, as well as through direct inhibition of serotonin activity within the area postrema and the chemoreceptor trigger zone."
DB00758,Clopidogrel,CHEMBL1771,"The active metabolite of clopidogrel prevents binding of adenosine diphosphate (ADP) to its platelet receptor, impairing the ADP-mediated activation of the glycoprotein GPIIb/IIIa complex. It is proposed that the inhibition involves a defect in the mobilization from the storage sites of the platelet granules to the outer membrane. he drug specifically and irreversibly inhibits the P2Y12 subtype of ADP receptor, which is important in aggregation of platelets and cross-linking by the protein fibrin. No direct interference occurs with the GPIIb/IIIa receptor. As the glycoprotein GPIIb/IIIa complex is the major receptor for fibrinogen, its impaired activation prevents fibrinogen binding to platelets and inhibits platelet aggregation. By blocking the amplification of platelet activation by released ADP, platelet aggregation induced by agonists other than ADP is also inhibited by the active metabolite of clopidogrel."
DB00759,Tetracycline,CHEMBL1440,"Tetracycline passively diffuses through porin channels in the bacterial membrane and reversibly binds to the 30S ribosomal subunit, preventing binding of tRNA to the mRNA-ribosome complex, and thus interfering with protein synthesis."
DB00760,Meropenem,CHEMBL127,"The bactericidal activity of meropenem results from the inhibition of cell wall synthesis. Meropenem readily penetrates the cell wall of most Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria to reach penicillin-binding- protein (PBP) targets. Its strongest affinities are toward PBPs 2, 3 and 4 of <i>Escherichia coli</i> and <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>; and PBPs 1, 2 and 4 of <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>."
DB00761,Potassium Chloride,CHEMBL1200731,Supplemental potassium in the form of high potassium food or potassium chloride may be able to restore normal potassium levels.
DB00762,Irinotecan,CHEMBL481,"Irinotecan inhibits the action of topoisomerase I. Irinotecan prevents religation of the DNA strand by binding to topoisomerase I-DNA complex. The formation of this ternary complex interferes with the moving replication fork, which induces replication arrest and lethal double-stranded breaks in DNA. As a result, DNA damage is not efficiently repaired and apoptosis (programmed cell death) occurs."
DB00763,Methimazole,CHEMBL1515,"Methimazole binds to thyroid peroxidase and thereby inhibits the conversion of iodide to iodine. Thyroid peroxidase normally converts iodide to iodine (via hydrogen peroxide as a cofactor) and also catalyzes the incorporation of the resulting iodide molecule onto both the 3 and/or 5 positions of the phenol rings of tyrosines found in thyroglobulin. Thyroglobulin is degraded to produce thyroxine (T4) and tri-iodothyronine (T3), which are the main hormones produced by the thyroid gland. So methimazole effectively inhibits the production of new thyroid hormones."
DB00764,Mometasone,CHEMBL1201404,"Unbound corticosteroids cross cell membranes and bind with high affinity to specific cytoplasmic receptors. Inflammation is decreased by diminishing the release of leukocytic acid hydrolases, prevention of macrophage accumulation at inflamed sites, interference with leukocyte adhesion to the capillary wall, reduction of capillary membrane permeability, reduction of complement components, inhibition of histamine and kinin release, and interference with the formation of scar tissue. The antiinflammatory actions of corticosteroids are thought to involve phospholipase A<sub>2</sub> inhibitory proteins, lipocortins, which control the biosynthesis of potent mediators of inflammation such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes. Mometasone furoate has been shown in vitro to exhibit a binding affinity for the human glucocorticoid receptor which is approximately 12 times that of dexamethasone, 7 times that of triamcinolone acetonide, 5 times that of budesonide, and 1.5 times that of fluticasone."
DB00765,Metyrosine,CHEMBL1200862,"Metyrosine inhibits tyrosine hydroxylase, which catalyzes the first transformation in catecholamine biosynthesis, i.e., the conversion of tyrosine to dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA). Because the first step is also the rate-limiting step, blockade of tyrosine hydroxylase activity results in decreased endogenous levels of catecholamines and their synthesis. This consequently, depletes the levels of the catecholamines dopamine, adrenaline and noradrenaline in the body,usually measured as decreased urinary excretion of catecholamines and their metabolites. One main end result of the catecholamine depletion is a decrease in blood presure."
DB00766,Clavulanate,CHEMBL777,"Clavulanic acid competitively and irreversibly inhibits a wide variety of beta-lactamases, commonly found in microorganisms resistant to penicillins and cephalosporins. Binding and irreversibly inhibiting the beta-lactamase results in a restauration of the antimicrobial activity of beta-lactam antibiotics against lactamase-secreting-resistant bacteria. By inactivating beta-lactamase (the bacterial resistance protein), the accompanying penicillin/cephalosporin drugs may be made more potent as well."
DB00767,Benzquinamide,CHEMBL1201250,"The mechanism of action is not known, but presumably benzquinamide works via antagonism of muscarinic acetycholine receptors and histamine H1 receptors."
DB00768,Olopatadine,CHEMBL1189432,"Olopatadine is a selective histamine H1 antagonist that binds to the histamine H1 receptor. This blocks the action of endogenous histamine, which subsequently leads to temporary relief of the negative symptoms brought on by histamine. Olopatadine is devoid of effects on alpha-adrenergic, dopamine and muscarinic type 1 and 2 receptors."
DB00769,Hydrocortamate,CHEMBL1201263,"Hydrocortamate binds to the cytosolic glucocorticoid receptor. After binding the receptor the newly formed receptor-ligand complex translocates itself into the cell nucleus, where it binds to many glucocorticoid response elements (GRE) in the promoter region of the target genes. The DNA bound receptor then interacts with basic transcription factors, causing the increase in expression of specific target genes. The anti-inflammatory actions of corticosteroids are thought to involve lipocortins, phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins which, through inhibition arachidonic acid, control the biosynthesis of prostaglandins and leukotrienes. The immune system is suppressed by corticosteroids due to a decrease in the function of the lymphatic system, a reduction in immunoglobulin and complement concentrations, the precipitation of lymphocytopenia, and interference with antigen-antibody binding."
DB00770,Alprostadil,CHEMBL495,"Alprostadil causes vasodilation by means of a direct effect on vascular and ductus arteriosus (DA) smooth muscle, preventing or reversing the functional closure of the DA that occurs shortly after birth. This is because, as a form of prostaglandinE1 (PGE1) it has multiple effects on blood flow. This results in increased pulmonary or systemic blood flow in infants. In cyanotic congenital heart disease, alprostadil's actions result in an increased oxygen supply to the tissues. In infants with interrupted aortic arch or very severe aortic coarctation, alprostadil maintains distal aortic perfusion by permitting blood flow through the DA from the pulmonary artery to the aorta. In infants with aortic coarctation, alprostadil reduces aortic obstruction either by relaxing ductus tissue in the aortic wall or by increasing effective aortic diameter by dilating the DA. In infants with these aortic arch anomalies, systemic blood flow to the lower body is increased, improving tissue oxygen supply and renal perfusion. When administered by intracavernosal injection or as an intraurethral suppository, alprostadil acts locally to relax the trabecular smooth muscle of the corpora cavernosa and the cavernosal arteries. Swelling, elongation, and rigidity of the penis result when arterial blood rapidly flows into the corpus cavernosum to expand the lacunar spaces. The entrapped blood reduces the venous blood outflow as sinusoids compress against the tunica albuginea."
DB00771,Clidinium,,Inhibits muscarinic actions of acetylcholine at postganglionic parasympathetic neuroeffector sites primarily by inhibiting the M1 muscarinic receptors.
DB00772,Malathion,CHEMBL1200468,"Malathion is a nonsystemic, wide-spectrum organophosphate insecticide. It inhibits acetylcholinesterase activity of most eukaryotes. Malathion is toxic to aquatic organisms, but has a relatively low toxicity for birds and mammals. The major metabolites of malathion are mono- and di-carboxylic acid derivatives, and malaoxon is a minor metabolite. However, it is malaoxon that is the strongest cholinesterase inhibitor. Cholinesterases catalyze the hydrolysis of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine into choline and acetic acid, a reaction necessary to allow a cholinergic neuron to return to its resting state after activation. Because of its essential function, chemicals that interfere with the action of cholinesterase are potent neurotoxins, causing muscle spasms and ultimately death."
DB00773,Etoposide,CHEMBL44657,"Etoposide inhibits DNA topoisomerase II, thereby inhibiting DNA re-ligation. This causes critical errors in DNA synthesis at the premitotic stage of cell division and can lead to apoptosis of the cancer cell. Etoposide is cell cycle dependent and phase specific, affecting mainly the S and G2 phases of cell division. Inhibition of the topoisomerase II alpha isoform results in the anti-tumour activity of etoposide. The drug is also capable of inhibiting the beta isoform but inhibition of this target is not associated with the anti-tumour activity. It is instead associated with the carcinogenic effect. "
DB00774,Hydroflumethiazide,CHEMBL1763,"Hydroflumethiazide is a thiazide diuretic that inhibits water reabsorption in the nephron by inhibiting the sodium-chloride symporter (SLC12A3) in the distal convoluted tubule, which is responsible for 5% of total sodium reabsorption. Normally, the sodium-chloride symporter transports sodium and chloride from the lumen into the epithelial cell lining the distal convoluted tubule. The energy for this is provided by a sodium gradient established by sodium-potassium ATPases on the basolateral membrane. Once sodium has entered the cell, it is transported out into the basolateral interstitium via the sodium-potassium ATPase, causing an increase in the osmolarity of the interstitium, thereby establishing an osmotic gradient for water reabsorption. By blocking the sodium-chloride symporter, Hydroflumethiazide effectively reduces the osmotic gradient and water reabsorption throughout the nephron."
DB00775,Tirofiban,CHEMBL916,"Tirofiban is a reversible antagonist of fibrinogen binding to the GP IIb/IIIa receptor, the major platelet surface receptor involved in platelet aggregation. Platelet aggregation inhibition is reversible following cessation of the infusion of tirofiban."
DB00776,Oxcarbazepine,CHEMBL1068,"The exact mechanism by which oxcarbazepine exerts its anticonvulsant effect is unknown. It is known that the pharmacological activity of oxcarbazepine occurs primarily through its 10-monohydroxy metabolite (MHD). In vitro studies indicate an MHD-induced blockade of voltage-sensitive sodium channels, resulting in stabilization of hyperexcited neuronal membranes, inhibition of repetitive neuronal discharges, and diminution of propagation of synaptic impulses."
DB00777,Propiomazine,CHEMBL1201210,"Propiomazine is an antagonist at types 1, 2, and 4 dopamine receptors, serotonin (5-HT) receptor types 2A and 2C, muscarinic receptors 1 through 5, alpha(1)-receptors, and histamine H1-receptors. Its main use as a sedative is due to its antihistamine effect."
DB00778,Roxithromycin,CHEMBL1214185,"Roxithromycin prevents bacteria from growing, by interfering with their protein synthesis. Roxithromycin binds to the subunit 50S of the bacterial ribosome, and thus inhibits the translocation of peptides. Roxithromycin has similar antimicrobial spectrum as erythromycin, but is more effective against certain gram-negative bacteria, particularly <i>Legionella pneumophila</i>."
DB00779,Nalidixic Acid,CHEMBL5,"Evidence exists for Nalidixic acid that its active metabolite, hydroxynalidixic acid, binds strongly, but reversibly, to DNA, interfering with synthesis of RNA and, consequently, with protein synthesis."
DB00780,Phenelzine,CHEMBL1089,"Although the exact mechanism of action has not been determined, it appears that the irreversible, nonselective inhibition of MAO by phenelzine relieves depressive symptoms by causing an increase in the levels of serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine in the neuron."
DB00781,Polymyxin B Sulfate,CHEMBL241797,"Polymyxin B sulfate has a bactericidal action against almost all gram-negative bacilli except the Proteus group. Polymyxin B sulfate interacts with the lipopolysaccharide of the cytoplasmic outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria, altering membrane permeability and causing cell death. It does not need to enter the cell."
DB00782,Propantheline,CHEMBL1180725,Action is achieved via a dual mechanism: (1) a specific anticholinergic effect (antimuscarinic) at the acetylcholine-receptor sites and (2) a direct effect upon smooth muscle (musculotropic).
DB00783,Estradiol,CHEMBL135,"Estradiol enters target cells freely (e.g., female organs, breasts, hypothalamus, pituitary) and interacts with a target cell receptor. When the estrogen receptor has bound its ligand it can enter the nucleus of the target cell, and regulate gene transcription which leads to formation of messenger RNA. The mRNA interacts with ribosomes to produce specific proteins that express the effect of estradiol upon the target cell. Estrogens increase the hepatic synthesis of sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), thyroid-binding globulin (TBG), and other serum proteins and suppress follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) from the anterior pituitary."
DB00784,Mefenamic acid,CHEMBL686,"Mefenamic acid binds the prostaglandin synthetase receptors COX-1 and COX-2, inhibiting the action of prostaglandin synthetase. As these receptors have a role as a major mediator of inflammation and/or a role for prostanoid signaling in activity-dependent plasticity, the symptoms of pain are temporarily reduced."
DB00785,Cryptenamine,,"Cryptenamine has a marked and re-producible depressor effect when given intravenously to hypertensive patients, however the mechanism of action is not known. Some evidence has suggested that cryptenamine acts in a similar fashion to atropine, which lowers the ""rest and digest"" activity of all muscles and glands regulated by the parasympathetic nervous system. This occurs because atropine is a competitive inhibitor of the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (acetylcholine is the neurotransmitter used by the parasympathetic nervous system). Therefore muscarinic acetylcholine receptors will be listed as experimental targets for cryptenamine."
DB00786,Marimastat,CHEMBL279785,"Marimastat is a broad spectrum matrix metalloprotease inhibitor. It mimics the peptide structure of natural MMP substrates and binds to matrix metalloproteases, thereby preventing the degradation of the basement membrane by these proteases. This antiprotease action prevents the migration of endothelial cells needed to form new blood vessels. Inhibition of MMPs also prevents the entry and exit of tumor cells into existing blood cells, thereby preventing metastasis."
DB00787,Aciclovir,CHEMBL184,"Viral (HSV-1, HSV-2 and VZV) thymidine kinase converts aciclovir to the aciclovir monophosphate, which is then converted to the diphosphate by cellular guanylate kinase, and finally to the triphosphate by phosphoglycerate kinase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, and pyruvate kinase. Aciclovir triphosphate competitively inhibits viral DNA polymerase and competes with the natural deoxyguanosine triphosphate, for incorporation into viral DNA. Once incorporated, aciclovir triphosphate inhibits DNA synthesis by acting as a chain terminator. One may consider aciclovir to be a prodrug as it is metabolized to more active compounds. Aciclovir is selective and low in cytotoxicity as the cellular thymidine kinase of normal, uninfected cells does not use aciclovir effectively as a substrate. "
DB00788,Naproxen,CHEMBL154,"The mechanism of action of naproxen, like that of other NSAIDs, is believed to be associated with the inhibition of cyclooxygenase activity. Two unique cyclooxygenases have been described in mammals. The constitutive cyclooxygenase, COX-1, synthesizes prostaglandins necessary for normal gastrointestinal and renal function. The inducible cyclooxygenase, COX-2, generates prostaglandins involved in inflammation. Inhibition of COX-1 is thought to be associated with gastrointestinal and renal toxicity while inhibition of COX-2 provides anti-inflammatory activity."
DB00789,Gadopentetate dimeglumine,CHEMBL1200431,"Based on the behavior of protons when placed in a strong magnetic field, which is interpreted and transformed into images by magnetic resonance (MR) instruments. MR images are based primarily on proton density and proton relaxation dynamics. MR instruments are sensitive to two different relaxation processes, the T1 (spin-lattice or longitudinal relaxation time) and T2 (spin-spin or transverse relaxation time). Paramagnetic agents contain one or more unpaired electrons that enhance the T1 and T2 relaxation rates of protons in their molecular environment. The proton relaxation effect (PRE) of an unpaired electron is 700 times stronger than that of a proton itself. In MRI, visualization of normal and pathological brain tissue depends in part on variations in the radio frequency signal intensity that occur with changes in proton density, alteration of the T1, and variation in T2. When placed in a magnetic field, gadopentetate dimeglumine shortens the T1 and T2 relaxation times in tissues where it accumulates. In the central nervous system (CNS), gadopentetate dimeglumine enhances visualization of normal tissues that lack a blood-brain barrier, such as the pituitary gland and the meninges. Gadopentetate dimeglumine does not cross the intact blood-brain barrier; therefore, it does not accumulate in normal brain tissue or in CNS lesions that have not caused an abnormal blood-brain barrier (e.g., cysts, mature post-operative scars). Abnormal vascularity or disruption of the blood-brain barrier allows accumulation of gadopentetate dimeglumine in lesions such as neoplasms, abscesses, and subacute infarcts. Outside the CNS, gadopentetate dimeglumine rapidly reaches equilibrium in the interstitial compartment and enhances signal in all tissues as a function of delivery and size of the interstitial compartment.
This compound has also been found to inhibit human erythrocyte 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase."
DB00790,Perindopril,CHEMBL1581,"There are two isoforms of ACE: the somatic isoform, which exists as a glycoprotein comprised of a single polypeptide chain of 1277; and the testicular isoform, which has a lower molecular mass and is thought to play a role in sperm maturation and binding of sperm to the oviduct epithelium. Somatic ACE has two functionally active domains, N and C, which arise from tandem gene duplication. Although the two domains have high sequence similarity, they play distinct physiological roles. The C-domain is predominantly involved in blood pressure regulation while the N-domain plays a role in hematopoietic stem cell differentiation and proliferation. ACE inhibitors bind to and inhibit the activity of both domains, but have much greater affinity for and inhibitory activity against the C-domain. Perindoprilat, the active metabolite of perindopril, competes with ATI for binding to ACE and inhibits and enzymatic proteolysis of ATI to ATII. Decreasing ATII levels in the body decreases blood pressure by inhibiting the pressor effects of ATII as described in the Pharmacology section above. Perindopril also causes an increase in plasma renin activity likely due to a loss of feedback inhibition mediated by ATII on the release of renin and/or stimulation of reflex mechanisms via baroreceptors.

The mechanism of action is unknown, but is thought to be via inhibition of oxygen uptake and disruption of yeast membrane structure and function. There is a higher incidence of cutaneous side effects with haloprogin, including irritation, burning, vesiculation (blisters), scaling, and itching. It is generally used when the infection is unresponsive to other antifungals."

DB00795,Sulfasalazine,CHEMBL421,"The mode of action of Sulfasalazine or its metabolites, 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) and sulfapyridine (SP), is still under investigation, but may be related to the anti-inflammatory and/or immunomodulatory properties that have been observed in animal and <i>in vitro</i> models, to its affinity for connective tissue, and/or to the relatively high concentration it reaches in serous fluids, the liver and intestinal walls, as demonstrated in autoradiographic studies in animals. In ulcerative colitis, clinical studies utilizing rectal administration of Sulfasalazine, SP and 5-ASA have indicated that the major therapeutic action may reside in the 5-ASA moiety. The relative contribution of the parent drug and the major metabolites in rheumatoid arthritis is unknown."
DB00796,Candesartan cilexetil,CHEMBL1014,"Candesartan selectively blocks the binding of angiotensin II to AT1 in many tissues including vascular smooth muscle and the adrenal glands. This inhibits the AT1-mediated vasoconstrictive and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II and results in an overall decrease in blood pressure. Candesartan is greater than 10,000 times more selective for AT1 than AT2. Inhibition of aldosterone secretion may increase sodium and water excretion while decreasing potassium excretion."
DB00797,Tolazoline,CHEMBL770,"Vasodilation by means of a direct effect on peripheral vascular smooth muscle and indirect effects produced, in part, by release of endogenous histamine; tolazoline has moderate alpha-adrenergic blocking activity and has histamine agonist activity. Tolazoline usually reduces pulmonary arterial pressure and vascular resistance."
DB00798,Gentamicin,CHEMBL329592,"Aminoglycosides like gentamicin ""irreversibly"" bind to specific 30S-subunit proteins and 16S rRNA. Specifically gentamicin binds to four nucleotides of 16S rRNA and a single amino acid of protein S12. This interferes with decoding site in the vicinity of nucleotide 1400 in 16S rRNA of 30S subunit. This region interacts with the wobble base in the anticodon of tRNA. This leads to interference with the initiation complex, misreading of mRNA so incorrect amino acids are inserted into the polypeptide leading to nonfunctional or toxic peptides and the breakup of polysomes into nonfunctional monosomes."
DB00799,Tazarotene,CHEMBL1657,"Although the exact mechanism of tazarotene action is not known, studies have shown that the active form of the drug (tazarotenic acid) binds to all three members of the retinoic acid receptor (RAR) family: RARa, RARb, and RARg, but shows relative selectivity for RARb, and RARg and may modify gene expression. It also has affinity for RXR receptors."
DB00800,Fenoldopam,CHEMBL588,"Fenoldopam is a rapid-acting vasodilator. It is an agonist for D<sub>1</sub>-like dopamine receptors and binds with moderate affinity to &alpha;<sub>2</sub>-adrenoceptors. It has no significant affinity for D<sub>2</sub>-like receptors, &alpha;<sub>1</sub> and &beta;-adrenoceptors, 5<sub>HT1</sub> and 5<sub>HT2</sub> receptors, or muscarinic receptors. Fenoldopam is a racemic mixture with the R-isomer responsible for the biological activity. The R-isomer has approximately 250-fold higher affinity for D<sub>1</sub>-like receptors than does the S-isomer. In non-clinical studies, fenoldopam had no agonist effect on presynaptic D<sub>2</sub>-like dopamine receptors, or &alpha; or &beta; -adrenoceptors, nor did it affect angiotensin-converting enzyme activity. Fenoldopam may increase norepinephrine plasma concentration."
DB00801,Halazepam,CHEMBL970,"Benzodiazepines bind nonspecifically to benzodiazepine receptors BNZ1, which mediates sleep, and BNZ2, which affects affects muscle relaxation, anticonvulsant activity, motor coordination, and memory. As benzodiazepine receptors are thought to be coupled to gamma-aminobutyric acid-A (GABAA) receptors, this enhances the effects of GABA by increasing GABA affinity for the GABA receptor. Binding of GABA to the site opens the chloride channel, resulting in a hyperpolarized cell membrane that prevents further excitation of the cell."
DB00802,Alfentanil,CHEMBL634,"Opiate receptors are coupled with G-protein receptors and function as both positive and negative regulators of synaptic transmission via G-proteins that activate effector proteins. Binding of the opiate stimulates the exchange of GTP for GDP on the G-protein complex. As the effector system is adenylate cyclase and cAMP located at the inner surface of the plasma membrane, opioids decrease intracellular cAMP by inhibiting adenylate cyclase. Subsequently, the release of nociceptive neurotransmitters such as substance P, GABA, dopamine, acetylcholine and noradrenaline is inhibited. Opioids also inhibit the release of vasopressin, somatostatin, insulin and glucagon. Alfentanil's analgesic activity is, most likely, due to its conversion to morphine. Opioids close N-type voltage-operated calcium channels (OP2-receptor agonist) and open calcium-dependent inwardly rectifying potassium channels (OP3 and OP1 receptor agonist). This results in hyperpolarization and reduced neuronal excitability."
DB00803,Colistin,CHEMBL407135,"Colistin is a surface active agent which penetrates into and disrupts the bacterial cell membrane. Colistin is polycationic and has both hydrophobic and lipophilic moieties. It interacts with the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane, changing its permeability. This effect is bactericidal. There is also evidence that polymyxins enter the cell and precipitate cytoplasmic components, primarily ribosomes."
DB00804,Dicyclomine,CHEMBL1123,Action is achieved via a dual mechanism: (1) a specific anticholinergic effect (antimuscarinic) at the acetylcholine-receptor sites and (2) a direct effect upon smooth muscle (musculotropic).
DB00805,Minaprine,CHEMBL278819,"Minaprine binds to serotonin type 2 receptors and to dopamine D1 and D2 type receptors. It also binds to the serotonin reuptake pump. Therefore, minaprine blocks the reuptake of both dopamine and serotonin. It is also, to a slight degree, cholinomimetic. Thus it may exhibit both mood-brightening and nootropic properties. It also acts as a reversible inhibitor of MAO-A (RIMA).It has also been found to inhibit acetylcholinesterase."
DB00806,Pentoxifylline,CHEMBL628,"Pentoxifylline inhibits erythrocyte phosphodiesterase, resulting in an increase in erythrocyte cAMP activity. Subsequently, the erythrocyte membrane becomes more resistant to deformity. Along with erythrocyte activity, pentoxifylline also decreases blood viscosity by reducing plasma fibrinogen concentrations and increasing fibrinolytic activity. It is also a non selective adenosine receptor antagonist."
DB00807,Proparacaine,CHEMBL1196,"The exact mechanism whereby proparacaine and other local anesthetics influence the permeability of the cell membrane is unknown; however, several studies indicate that local anesthetics may limit sodium ion permeability through the lipid layer of the nerve cell membrane. Proparacaine may alter epithelial sodium channels through interaction with channel protein residues. This limitation prevents the fundamental change necessary for the generation of the action potential."
DB00808,Indapamide,CHEMBL406,Indapamide blocks the slow component of delayed rectifier potassium current (IKs) without altering the rapid component (IKr) or the inward rectifier current. Specifically it blocks or antagonizes the action the proteins KCNQ1 and KCNE1. Indapamide is also thought to stimulate the synthesis of the vasodilatory hypotensive prostaglandin PGE2.
DB00809,Tropicamide,CHEMBL1200604,"Tropicamide binds to and blocks the receptors in the muscles of the eye (muscarinic receptor M4). Tropicamide acts by blocking the responses of the iris sphincter muscle to the iris and ciliary muscles to cholinergic stimulation, producing dilation of the pupil and paralysis of the ciliary muscle."
DB00810,Biperiden,CHEMBL1101,"Parkinsonism is thought to result from an imbalance between the excitatory (cholinergic) and inhibitory (dopaminergic) systems in the corpus striatum. The mechanism of action of centrally active anticholinergic drugs such as biperiden is considered to relate to competitive antagonism of acetylcholine at cholinergic receptors in the corpus striatum, which then restores the balance."
DB00811,Ribavirin,CHEMBL1643,"Ribavirin is reported to have several mechanism of actions that lead to inhibition of viral RNA and protein synthesis. 
Ribavirin is phosphorylated intracellularly by adenosine kinase to ribavirin mono-, di-, and triphosphate metabolites. Ribavirin triphosphate (RTP) is the predominant metabolite which directly inhibits viral mRNA polymerase by binding to the nucleotide binding site of the enzyme. This prevents the binding of the correct nucleotides, leading to a reduction in viral replication or to the production of defective virions [A19645]. RTP also demonstrates an inhibitory action on viral mRNA guanylyltransferase and mRNA 2′-O-methyltransferase of dengue virus. Inhibition of these enzymes disrupts the posttranslational capping of the 5′ end of viral mRNA through ribavirin being incorporated at the 5′ end in place of guanosine and preventing the cap methylation step. 

Inhibition of host inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) and subsequent depletion of GTP pool is proposed to be another mechanism of action of ribavirin. IMPDH catalyzes the rate-limiting step where inosine 5′-monophosphate is converted to xanthine monophosphate during guanosine monophosphate (GMP) synthesis. GMP is later converted to guanosine triphoshpate (GTP). Ribavirin monophosphate mimics inosine 5′-monophosphate and acts as a competitive inhibitor of IMPDH. Inhibited de novo synthesis of guanine nucleotides and decreased intracellular GTP pools leads to a decline in viral protein synthesis and limit replication of viral genomes [A19645].

Ribavirin acts as a mutagen in the target virus to cause an 'error catastrophe' due to increased viral mutations. RTP pairs with cytidine triphosphate or uridine triphosphate with equal efficiency and to block HCV RNA elongation. It causes premature termination of nascent HCV RNA and increases mutagenesis by producing defective virions [A19645].

Ribavirin also exerts an immunomodulatory action of the host to the virus by shifting a Th2 response in favor of a Th1 phenotype. Th2 response and production of type 2 cytokines such as IL-4, IL-5, and IL-10 stimulates the humoral response which enhances immunity toward the virus [A19645]. Ribavirin enhanced induction of interferon-related genes, including the interferon-α receptor, and down-regulation of genes involved in interferon inhibition, apoptosis, and hepatic stellate cell activation in vitro [A19644]. "
DB00812,Phenylbutazone,CHEMBL101,Phenylbutazone binds to and inactivates prostaglandin H synthase and prostacyclin synthase through peroxide (H2O2) mediated deactivation. The reduced production of prostaglandin leads to reduced inflammation of the surrounding tissues.
DB00813,Fentanyl,CHEMBL596,"Opiate receptors are coupled with G-protein receptors and function as both positive and negative regulators of synaptic transmission via G-proteins that activate effector proteins. Binding of the opiate stimulates the exchange of GTP for GDP on the G-protein complex. As the effector system is adenylate cyclase and cAMP located at the inner surface of the plasma membrane, opioids decrease intracellular cAMP by inhibiting adenylate cyclase. Subsequently, the release of nociceptive neurotransmitters such as substance P, GABA, dopamine, acetylcholine and noradrenaline is inhibited. Opioids also inhibit the release of vasopressin, somatostatin, insulin and glucagon. Fentanyl's analgesic activity is, most likely, due to its conversion to morphine. Opioids close N-type voltage-operated calcium channels (OP2-receptor agonist) and open calcium-dependent inwardly rectifying potassium channels (OP3 and OP1 receptor agonist). This results in hypopolarization and reduced neuronal excitability."
DB00814,Meloxicam,CHEMBL599,"Anti-inflammatory effects of meloxicam are believed to be due to inhibition of prostaglandin synthetase (cylooxygenase), leading to the inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis. As prostaglandins sensitize pain receptors, inhibition of their synthesis may be associated with the analgesic and antipyretic effects of meloxicam."
DB00815,Sodium lauryl sulfate,CHEMBL23393,"Like other surfactants, SLS is amphiphilic. It thus migrates to the surface of liquids, where its alignment and aggregation with other SLS molecules lowers the surface tension. This allows for easier spreading and mixing of the liquid. SLS has potent protein denaturing activity and inhibits the infectivity of viruses by by solubilizing the viral envelope and/or by denaturing envelope and/or capsid proteins."
DB00816,Orciprenaline,CHEMBL776,"Orciprenaline is a moderately selective beta(2)-adrenergic agonist that stimulates receptors of the smooth muscle in the lungs, uterus, and vasculature supplying skeletal muscle, with minimal or no effect on alpha-adrenergic receptors. Intracellularly, the actions of orciprenaline are mediated by cAMP, the production of which is augmented by beta stimulation. The drug is believed to work by activating adenylate cyclase, the enzyme responsible for producing the cellular mediator cAMP."
DB00817,Rosoxacin,CHEMBL291157,"Rosoxacin binds to and inhibits the enzymes topoisomerase II (DNA gyrase) and topoisomerase IV, which are required for bacterial DNA replication, transcription, repair, and recombination."
DB00818,Propofol,CHEMBL526,The action of propofol involves a positive modulation of the inhibitory function of the neurotransmitter gama-aminobutyric acid (GABA) through GABA-A receptors.
DB00819,Acetazolamide,CHEMBL20,"The anticonvulsant activity of Acetazolamide may depend on a direct inhibition of carbonic anhydrase in the CNS, which decreases carbon dioxide tension in the pulmonary alveoli, thus increasing arterial oxygen tension. The diuretic effect depends on the inhibition of carbonic anhydrase, causing a reduction in the availability of hydrogen ions for active transport in the renal tubule lumen. This leads to alkaline urine and an increase in the excretion of bicarbonate, sodium, potassium, and water."
DB00820,Tadalafil,CHEMBL779,"Tadalafil inhibits the cGMP specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) which is responsible for degradation of cGMP in the corpus cavernosum located around the penis. Penile erection during sexual stimulation is caused by increased penile blood flow resulting from the relaxation of penile arteries and corpus cavernosal smooth muscle. This response is mediated by the release of nitric oxide (NO) from nerve terminals and endothelial cells, which stimulates the synthesis of cGMP in smooth muscle cells. Cyclic GMP causes smooth muscle relaxation and increased blood flow into the corpus cavernosum. The inhibition of phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) by tadalafil enhances erectile function by increasing the amount of cGMP."
DB00821,Carprofen,CHEMBL1316,"The mechanism of action of carprofen, like that of other NSAIDs, is believed to be associated with the inhibition of cyclooxygenase activity. Two unique cyclooxygenases have been described in mammals. The constitutive cyclooxygenase, COX-1, synthesizes prostaglandins necessary for normal gastrointestinal and renal function. The inducible cyclooxygenase, COX-2, generates prostaglandins involved in inflammation. Inhibition of COX-1 is thought to be associated with gastrointestinal and renal toxicity while inhibition of COX-2 provides anti-inflammatory activity. In an <i>in vitro</i> study using canine cell cultures, carprofen demonstrated selective inhibition of COX-2 versus COX-1."
DB00822,Disulfiram,CHEMBL964,"Disulfiram blocks the oxidation of alcohol at the acetaldehyde stage during alcohol metabolism following disulfiram intake causing an accumulation of acetaldehyde in the blood producing highly unpleasant symptoms. Disulfiram blocks the oxidation of alcohol through its irreversible inactivation of aldehyde dehydrogenase, which acts in the second step of ethanol utilization. In addition, disulfiram competitively binds and inhibits the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor, which may indicate some value in the treatment of the symptoms of alcohol withdrawal, however this activity has not been extensively studied."
DB00823,Ethynodiol diacetate,CHEMBL1200624,"Binds to the progesterone and estrogen receptors. Target cells include the female reproductive tract, the mammary gland, the hypothalamus, and the pituitary. Once bound to the receptor, progestins like Ethynodiol Diacetate will slow the frequency of release of gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) from the hypothalamus and blunt the pre-ovulatory LH (luteinizing hormone) surge."
DB00824,Enprofylline,CHEMBL279898,"Enprofylline inhibits erythrocyte phosphodiesterase, resulting in an increase in erythrocyte cAMP activity. Subsequently, the erythrocyte membrane becomes more resistant to deformity. Along with erythrocyte activity, enprofylline also decreases blood viscosity by reducing plasma fibrinogen concentrations and increasing fibrinolytic activity."
DB00825,Menthol,CHEMBL470670,"Menthol primarily activates the cold-sensitive TRPM8 receptors in the skin. Menthol, after topical application, causes a feeling of coolness due to stimulation of 'cold' receptors by inhibiting Ca++ currents of neuronal membranes. It may also yield analgesic properties via kappa-opioid receptor agonism. "
DB00826,Natamycin,CHEMBL1200656,"LIke other polyene antibiotics, Natamycin inhibits fungal growth by binding to sterols. Specifically, Natamycin binds to ergosterol in the plasma membrane, preventing ergosterol-dependent fusion of vacuoles, as well as membrane fusion and fission. This differs from the mechanism of most other polyene antibiotics, which tend to work by altering fungal membrane permeability instead."
DB00827,Cinoxacin,CHEMBL1208,"Evidence exists that cinoxacin binds strongly, but reversibly, to DNA, interfering with synthesis of RNA and, consequently, with protein synthesis. It appears to also inhibit DNA gyrase. This enzyme is necessary for proper replicated DNA separation. By inhibiting this enzyme, DNA replication and cell division is inhibited."
DB00828,Fosfomycin,CHEMBL1757,"Fosfomycin is a phosphoenolpyruvate analogue produced by Streptomyces that irreversibly inhibits enolpyruvate transferase (MurA), which prevents the formation of N-acetylmuramic acid, an essential element of the peptidoglycan cell wall."
DB00829,Diazepam,CHEMBL12,"Benzodiazepines bind nonspecifically to benzodiazepine receptors which mediate sleep, affects muscle relaxation, anticonvulsant activity, motor coordination, and memory. As benzodiazepine receptors are thought to be coupled to gamma-aminobutyric acid-A (GABA<sub>A</sub>) receptors, this enhances the effects of GABA by increasing GABA affinity for the GABA receptor. Binding of GABA to the site opens the chloride channel, resulting in a hyperpolarized cell membrane that prevents further excitation of the cell."
DB00830,Phenmetrazine,CHEMBL1201208,"Phenmetrazine is thought to block the reuptake of norepinephrine and dopamine into the presynaptic neuron leading to an increase in the release of these monoamines into the extraneuronal space. Dopamine integrates incoming sensory stimuli, initiates and controls fine movement (nigro-neostriatal pathway), controls emotional behavior (midbrain mesolimbic-forebrain system) and controls hypothalamic-pituitary endocrine system (tubero-infundibular system). It is this latter effect on the tubero-infundibular systm that seems to lead to reduced food intake. Phenmetrazine also acts as a monoamine oxidase inhibitor."
DB00831,Trifluoperazine,CHEMBL422,"Trifluoperazine blocks postsynaptic mesolimbic dopaminergic D1 and D2 receptors in the brain; depresses the release of hypothalamic and hypophyseal hormones and is believed to depress the reticular activating system thus affecting basal metabolism, body temperature, wakefulness, vasomotor tone, and emesis."
DB00832,Phensuximide,CHEMBL797,"Phensuximide's mechanism of action not understood, but may act in inhibitory neuronal systems that are important in the generation of the three per second rhythm. It's effects may be related to its ability to inhibit depolarization-induced accumulation of cyclic AMP and cyclic GMP in brain tissue."
DB00833,Cefaclor,CHEMBL680,"Cefaclor, like the penicillins, is a beta-lactam antibiotic. By binding to specific penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) located inside the bacterial cell wall, it inhibits the third and last stage of bacterial cell wall synthesis. Cell lysis is then mediated by bacterial cell wall autolytic enzymes such as autolysins. It is possible that cefaclor interferes with an autolysin inhibitor."
DB00834,Mifepristone,CHEMBL1276308,"The anti-progestational activity of mifepristone results from competitive interaction with progesterone at progesterone-receptor sites. Based on studies with various oral doses in several animal species (mouse, rat, rabbit and monkey), the compound inhibits the activity of endogenous or exogenous progesterone. The termination of pregnancy results.

In the treatment of Cushing's syndrome, Mifepristone blocks the binding of cortisol to its receptor. It does not decrease cortisol production but reduces the effects of excess cortisol, such as high blood sugar levels."
DB00835,Brompheniramine,CHEMBL811,"Brompheniramine works by acting as an antagonist of the H1 histamine receptors. It also functions as a moderately effective anticholingeric agent, likely an antimuscarinic agent similar to other common antihistamines such as diphenhydramine. Its effects on the cholinergic system may include side-effects such as drowsiness, sedation, dry mouth, dry throat, blurred vision, and increased heart rate."
DB00836,Loperamide,CHEMBL841,<i>In vitro</i> and animal studies show that Loperamide acts by slowing intestinal motility and by affecting water and electrolyte movement through the bowel. Loperamide inhibits peristaltic activity by a direct effect on the circular and longitudinal muscles of the intestinal wall. It is a non-selective calcium channel blocker and binds to opioid mu-receptors. Evidence also suggests that at higher concentrations it binds to calmodulin.
DB00837,Progabide,CHEMBL287631,"Progabide binds to both GABA<sub>A</sub> and GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors located on the terminals of primary afferent fibers. Binding to GABA<sub>A</sub> results in an increased affinity of the GABA receptor for the amino acid, an augmented flux of chloride ions across the terminal membrane, and an increase in the amount of presynaptic inhibition. Activation of the GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors retards the influx of calcium ions into the terminals, thereby reducing the evoked release of excitatory amino acids and possibly other transmitters."
DB00838,Clocortolone,,"The precise mechanism of the antiinflammatory activity of topical steroids in the treatment of steroid-responsive dermatoses, in general, is uncertain. However, corticosteroids are thought to act by the induction of phospholipase A<sub>2</sub> inhibitory proteins, collectively called lipocortins. It is postulated that these proteins control the biosynthesis of potent mediators of inflammation such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes by inhibiting the release of their common precursor arachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid is released from membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A<sub>2</sub>. These enzyme transcriptional changes are mediated by the drug binding first to the glucocorticoid receptor. This complex can migrate to the cell nucleus which then binds to DNA initiating genetic activation and repression of various genes."
DB00839,Tolazamide,CHEMBL817,"Sulfonylureas likely bind to ATP-sensitive potassium-channel receptors on the pancreatic cell surface, reducing potassium conductance and causing depolarization of the membrane. Depolarization stimulates calcium ion influx through voltage-sensitive calcium channels, raising intracellular concentrations of calcium ions, which induces the secretion, or exocytosis, of insulin."
DB00840,Hydroxypropyl cellulose,CHEMBL1201471,"Hydroxypropyl cellulose is a derivative of cellulose that is soluble in both water and organic solvents. It is particularly good at trapping water and producing a film that serves as a barrier to water loss. Hydroxypropyl cellulose possesses good surface activity but does not gel as it forms open helical coils. In general Hydroxypropyl cellulose is a water-soluble thickener, emulsifier and film-former often used in tablet coating."
DB00841,Dobutamine,CHEMBL926,"Dobutamine directly stimulates beta-1 receptors of the heart to increase myocardial contractility and stroke volume, resulting in increased cardiac output."
DB00842,Oxazepam,CHEMBL568,"Similar to other benzodiazepines, oxazepam exerts its anxiolytic effects by potentiating the effect of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) on GABA-A receptors through a cooperative mechanism of action. GABA receptors are ionotropic chloride-linked channel receptors that produce inhibitory postsynaptic potentials. When activated by GABA, the GABA receptor/chloride ionophore complex undergoes a conformational change that allows the passage of chloride ions through the channel. Benzodiazepines are believed to exert their effect by increasing the effect of GABA at its receptor. Benzodiazepine binding increases chloride conductance in the presence of GABA by increasing the frequency at which the channel opens. In contrast, barbiturates increase chloride conductance in the presence of GABA by prolonging the time in which the channel remains open. There are 18 subtypes of the GABA receptor subunits. The &alpha;<sub>2</sub> subunit of the &alpha;<sub>2</sub>&beta;<sub>3</sub>&gamma;<sub>2</sub> receptor complex is thought to mediate anxiolytic effects while the &alpha;<sub>1</sub> subunit of the &alpha;<sub>1</sub>&beta;<sub>2</sub>&gamma;<sub>2</sub> receptor complex is thought to mediate sedative, anticonvulsant and anterograde amnesia effects. "
DB00843,Donepezil,CHEMBL502,"Donepezil is a piperidine derivative that is a centerally active, reversible inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase. This drug is structurally unrelated to other anticholinesterase agents. Donepezil's proposed mechanism of action involves the reversible inhibition of cholinesterases (eg. acetylcholinesterase), which prevents the hydrolysis of acetycholine, and leads to an increased concentration of acetylcholine at cholinergic synapses. Evidence suggests that the anticholinesterase activity of donepezil is relatively specific for acetylcholinesterase in the brain."
DB00844,Nalbuphine,CHEMBL895,"The exact mechanism of action is unknown, but is believed to interact with an opiate receptor site in the CNS (probably in or associated with the limbic system). The opiate antagonistic effect may result from competitive inhibition at the opiate receptor, but may also be a result of other mechanisms. Nalbuphine is thought primarily to be a kappa agonist. It is also a partial mu antagonist analgesic, with some binding to the delta receptor and minimal agonist activity at the sigma receptor."
DB00845,Clofazimine,CHEMBL1292,"Appears to preferentially bind to mycobacterial DNA leading to disruption of the cell cycle and eventually kills the bacterium. It may also bind to bacterial potassium transporters, thereby inhibiting their function. Lysophospholipids have been found to mediate the activity of this drug."
DB00846,Flurandrenolide,CHEMBL1201012,"Flurandrenolide is a topical corticosteroid.  It is normally applied to a plastic tape called Cordran.  Cordran is primarily effective because of its anti-inflammatory, antipruritic, and vasoconstrictive actions. Flurandrenolide, which is slowly released from the Cordran tape, binds to the cytosolic glucocorticoid receptor. After binding the receptor the newly formed receptor-ligand complex translocates itself into the cell nucleus, where it binds to many glucocorticoid response elements (GRE) in the promoter region of the target genes. The DNA bound receptor then interacts with basic transcription factors, causing the increase in expression of specific target genes. The anti-inflammatory actions of corticosteroids are thought to involve lipocortins, phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins which, through inhibition arachidonic acid, control the biosynthesis of prostaglandins and leukotrienes. Specifically glucocorticoids induce lipocortin-1 (annexin-1) synthesis, which then binds to cell membranes preventing the phospholipase A2 from coming into contact with its substrate arachidonic acid. This leads to diminished eicosanoid production. Cyclooxygenase (both COX-1 and COX-2) expression is also suppressed, potentiating the effect. In another words, the two main products in inflammation Prostaglandins and Leukotrienes are inhibited by the action of Glucocorticoids. Glucocorticoids also stimulate the lipocortin-1 escaping to the extracellular space, where it binds to the leukocyte membrane receptors and inhibits various inflammatory events: epithelial adhesion, emigration, chemotaxis, phagocytosis, respiratory burst and the release of various inflammatory mediators (lysosomal enzymes, cytokines, tissue plasminogen activator, chemokines etc.) from neutrophils, macrophages and mastocytes. Additionally the immune system is suppressed by corticosteroids due to a decrease in the function of the lymphatic system, a reduction in immunoglobulin and complement concentrations, the precipitation of lymphocytopenia, and interference with antigen-antibody binding.  Like other glucocorticoid agents Fluocinolone acetonide acts as a physiological antagonist to insulin by decreasing glycogenesis (formation of glycogen).  It also promotes the breakdown of lipids (lipolysis), and proteins, leading to the mobilization of extrahepatic amino acids and ketone bodies. This leads to increased circulating glucose concentrations (in the blood). There is also decreased glycogen formation in the liver.

DB00847,Cysteamine,CHEMBL602,"The free thiol cysteamine depletes cystinotic leukocytes and other cells of cystine, whose accumulation is considered the cause of organ damage in cystinosis. Cysteamine cleaves the disulfide bond with cystine to produce molecules that can escape the metabolic defect in cystinosis and cystinuria."
DB00848,Levamisole,CHEMBL1454,"The mechanism of action of levamisole as an antiparasitic agent appears to be tied to its agnositic activity towards the L-subtype nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in nematode muscles. This agonistic action reduces the capacity of the males to control their reproductive muscles and limits their ability to copulate. The mechanism of action of Levamisole as an anticancer drug in combination with fluorouracil is unknown. The effects of levamisole on the immune system are complex. The drug appears to restore depressed immune function rather than to stimulate response to above-normal levels. Levamisole can stimulate formation of antibodies to various antigens, enhance T-cell responses by stimulating T-cell activation and proliferation, potentiate monocyte and macrophage functions including phagocytosis and chemotaxis, and increase neutrophil mobility, adherence, and chemotaxis."
DB00849,Methylphenobarbital,CHEMBL45029,"Methylphenobarbital binds at a distinct binding site associated with a Cl<sup>-</sup> ionopore at the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor, increasing the duration of time for which the Cl<sup>-</sup> ionopore is open. The post-synaptic inhibitory effect of GABA in the thalamus is, therefore, prolonged."
DB00850,Perphenazine,CHEMBL567,Binds to the dopamine D1 and dopamine D2 receptors and inhibits their activity. The mechanism of the anti-emetic effect is due predominantly to blockage of the dopamine D2 neurotransmitter receptors in the chemoreceptor trigger zone and vomiting centre. Perphenazine also binds the alpha andrenergic receptor. This receptor's action is mediated by association with G proteins that activate a phosphatidylinositol-calcium second messenger system.
DB00851,Dacarbazine,CHEMBL476,"The mechanism of action is not known, but appears to exert cytotoxic effects via its action as an alkylating agent. Other theories include DNA synthesis inhibition by its action as a purine analog, and interaction with SH groups. Dacarbazine is not cell cycle-phase specific."
DB00852,Pseudoephedrine,CHEMBL1590,"Pseudoephedrine acts directly on both alpha- and, to a lesser degree, beta-adrenergic receptors. Through direct action on alpha-adrenergic receptors in the mucosa of the respiratory tract, pseudoephedrine produces vasoconstriction. Pseudoephedrine relaxes bronchial smooth muscle by stimulating beta2-adrenergic receptors. Like ephedrine, pseudoephedrine releasing norepinephrine from its storage sites, an indirect effect. This is its main and direct mechanism of action. The displaced noradrenaline is released into the neuronal synapse where it is free to activate the postsynaptic adrenergic receptors."
DB00853,Temozolomide,CHEMBL810,"Temozolomide is not active until it is converted at physiologic pH to MTIC. It is suggested that MTIC then alkylates DNA at the N7 position of guanine, O3 position of adenosine, and O6 position of guanosine, with the most common site being the N7 position. This methylation of guanine residues lead to single and double-strand DNA breaks and subsequent apoptotic cell death. It is suggested that the N7-methylguanine plays a critical role in the antitumor activity of the drug, as there is a correlation between the sensitivity of tumor cell lines to temozolomide and the activity of O6-alkylguanine alkyltransferase, which is the DNA repair protein that specifically removes alkyl groups at the O6 position of guanine. Cells lines that have lower levels of AGT are more sensitive to the cytotoxicity of temozolomide. It is also suggested that cytotoxic mechanism of temozolomide is related to the failure of the DNA MMR system to find a complementary base for methylated guanine. The DNA MMR system is involved in the formation of a number of proteins that remove methylated guanine. Evidence shows that when this repair process is targeted to the DNA strand opposite the O6-methylguanine, its inability to find the correct target leads to long-lived nicks in the DNA. The accumulation of these nicks lead to the inhibition of replication in the daughter cells, thereby blocking the cell cycle at the G<sub>2</sub>-M boundary."
DB00854,Levorphanol,CHEMBL592,Like other mu-agonist opioids it is believed to act at receptors in the periventricular and periaqueductal gray matter in both the brain and spinal cord to alter the transmission and perception of pain.
DB00855,Aminolevulinic acid,CHEMBL601,"According to the presumed mechanism of action, photosensitization following application of aminolevulinic acid (ALA) topical solution occurs through the metabolic conversion of ALA to protoporphyrin IX (PpIX), which accumulates in the skin to which aminolevulinic acid has been applied. When exposed to light of appropriate wavelength and energy, the accumulated PpIX produces a photodynamic reaction, a cytotoxic process dependent upon the simultaneous presence of light and oxygen. The absorption of light results in an excited state of the porphyrin molecule, and subsequent spin transfer from PpIX to molecular oxygen generates singlet oxygen, which can further react to form superoxide and hydroxyl radicals. Photosensitization of actinic (solar) keratosis lesions using aminolevulinic acid, plus illumination with the BLU-UTM Blue Light Photodynamic Therapy Illuminator (BLU-U), is the basis for aminolevulinic acid photodynamic therapy (PDT)."
DB00856,Chlorphenesin,CHEMBL388751,"The mechanism of action of chlorphenesin is not well defined, and its effects are measured mainly by subjective responses. It is known that chlorphenesin acts in the central nervous system (CNS) rather than directly on skeletal muscle."
DB00857,Terbinafine,CHEMBL822,"Terbinafine is hypothesized to act by inhibiting squalene monooxygenase, thus blocking the biosynthesis of ergosterol, an essential component of fungal cell membranes. This inhibition also results in an accumulation of squalene, which is a substrate catalyzed to 2,3-oxydo squalene by squalene monooxygenase. The resultant high concentration of squalene and decreased amount of ergosterol are both thought to contribute to terbinafine's antifungal activity."
DB00858,Drostanolone,CHEMBL1582,"Dromostanolone is a synthetic androgenic anabolic steroid and is approximately 5 times as potent as natural methyltestosterone. Like testosterone and other androgenic hormones, dromostanolone binds to the androgen receptor. This causes downstream genetic transcriptional changes. This ultimately causes retention of nitrogen, potassium, and phosphorus; increases protein anabolism; and decreases amino acid catabolism. The antitumour activity of dromostanolone appears related to reduction or competitive inhibition of prolactin receptors or estrogen receptors or production."
DB00859,Penicillamine,CHEMBL1430,"Penicillamine is a chelating agent recommended for the removal of excess copper in patients with Wilson's disease. From in vitro studies which indicate that one atom of copper combines with two molecules of penicillamine. Penicillamine also reduces excess cystine excretion in cystinuria. This is done, at least in part, by disulfide interchange between penicillamine and cystine, resulting in formation of penicillamine-cysteine disulfide, a substance that is much more soluble than cystine and is excreted readily. Penicillamine interferes with the formation of cross-links between tropocollagen molecules and cleaves them when newly formed. The mechanism of action of penicillamine in rheumatoid arthritis is unknown although it appears to suppress disease activity. Unlike cytotoxic immunosuppressants, penicillamine markedly lowers IgM rheumatoid factor but produces no significant depression in absolute levels of serum immunoglobulins. Also unlike cytotoxic immunosuppressants which act on both, penicillamine in vitro depresses T-cell activity but not B-cell activity."
DB00860,Prednisolone,CHEMBL131,"Glucocorticoids such as Prednisolone can inhibit leukocyte infiltration at the site of inflammation, interfere with mediators of inflammatory response, and suppress humoral immune responses. The antiinflammatory actions of glucocorticoids are thought to involve phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins, lipocortins, which control the biosynthesis of potent mediators of inflammation such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes. Prednisolone reduces inflammatory reaction by limiting the capillary dilatation and permeability of the vascular structures. These compounds restrict the accumulation of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and macrophages and reduce the release of vasoactive kinins. Recent research suggests that corticosteroids may inhibit the release of arachidonic acid from phospholipids, thereby reducing the formation of prostaglandins. Prednisolone is a glucocorticoid receptor agonist. On binding, the corticoreceptor-ligand complex translocates itself into the cell nucleus, where it binds to many glucocorticoid response elements (GRE) in the promoter region of the target genes. The DNA bound receptor then interacts with basic transcription factors, causing an increase or decrease in expression of specific target genes, including suppression of IL2 (interleukin 2) expression."
DB00861,Diflunisal,CHEMBL898,"The precise mechanism of the analgesic and anti-inflammatory actions of diflunisal is not known. Diflunisal is a prostaglandin synthetase inhibitor. In animals, prostaglandins sensitize afferent nerves and potentiate the action of bradykinin in inducing pain. Since prostaglandins are known to be among the mediators of pain and inflammation, the mode of action of diflunisal may be due to a decrease of prostaglandins in peripheral tissues."
DB00862,Vardenafil,CHEMBL1520,"Vardenafil inhibits the cGMP specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) which is responsible for degradation of cGMP in the corpus cavernosum located around the penis. Penile erection during sexual stimulation is caused by increased penile blood flow resulting from the relaxation of penile arteries and corpus cavernosal smooth muscle. This response is mediated by the release of nitric oxide (NO) from nerve terminals and endothelial cells, which stimulates the synthesis of cGMP in smooth muscle cells. Cyclic GMP causes smooth muscle relaxation and increased blood flow into the corpus cavernosum. The inhibition of phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) by vardenafil enhances erectile function by increasing the amount of cGMP."
DB00863,Ranitidine,CHEMBL512,"The H2 antagonists are competitive inhibitors of histamine at the parietal cell H2 receptor. They suppress the normal secretion of acid by parietal cells and the meal-stimulated secretion of acid. They accomplish this by two mechanisms: histamine released by ECL cells in the stomach is blocked from binding on parietal cell H2 receptors which stimulate acid secretion, and other substances that promote acid secretion (such as gastrin and acetylcholine) have a reduced effect on parietal cells when the H2 receptors are blocked."
DB00864,Tacrolimus,CHEMBL269732,"The mechanism of action of tacrolimus in atopic dermatitis is not known. While the following have been observed, the clinical significance of these observations in atopic dermatitis is not known. It has been demonstrated that tacrolimus inhibits T-lymphocyte activation by first binding to an intracellular protein, FKBP-12. A complex of tacrolimus-FKBP-12, calcium, calmodulin, and calcineurin is then formed and the phosphatase activity of calcineurin is inhibited. This prevents the dephosphorylation and translocation of nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NF-AT), a nuclear component thought to initiate gene transcription for the formation of lymphokines. Tacrolimus also inhibits the transcription for genes which encode IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, GM-CSF, and TNF-, all of which are involved in the early stages of T-cell activation. Additionally, tacrolimus has been shown to inhibit the release of pre-formed mediators from skin mast cells and basophils, and to downregulate the expression of FceRI on Langerhans cells."
DB00865,Benzphetamine,CHEMBL3545985,"Although the mechanism of action of the sympathomimetic appetite suppressants in the treatment of obesity is not fully known, these medications have pharmacological effects similar to those of amphetamines. Amphetamine and related sympathomimetic medications (such as benzphetamine) are thought to stimulate the release of norepinephrine and/or dopamine from storage sites in nerve terminals in the lateral hypothalamic feeding center, thereby producing a decrease in appetite. This release is mediated by the binding of benzphetamine to centrally located adrenergic receptors."
DB00866,Alprenolol,CHEMBL266195,"Alprenolol non-selectively blocks beta-1 adrenergic receptors mainly in the heart, inhibiting the effects of epinephrine and norepinephrine resulting in a decrease in heart rate and blood pressure. Also, with a more minor effect, by binding beta-2 receptors in the juxtaglomerular apparatus, alprenolol inhibits the production of renin, thereby inhibiting angiotensin II and aldosterone production and therefore inhibits the vasoconstriction and water retention due to angiotensin II and aldosterone, respectively."
DB00867,Ritodrine,CHEMBL785,"Ritodrine is beta-2 adrenergic agonist. It binds to beta-2 adrenergic receptors on outer membrane of myometrial cell, activates adenyl cyclase to increase the level of cAMP which decreases intracellular calcium and leads to a decrease of uterine contractions."
DB00868,Benzonatate,CHEMBL1374379,"Benzonatate acts peripherally, anesthetizing the stretch receptors of vagal afferent fibers in the alveoli of the lungs, bronchi, and pleura. Since these receptors are responsible for mediating the cough reflex, anesthetizing these receptors result in the inhibiton of cough production. Benzonatate also suppresses transmission of the cough reflex at the level of the medulla where the afferent impulse is transmitted to the motor nerves. When applied locally, Benzonatate binds within the intracellular portion of voltage-gated sodium channels, decreasing the rate of membrane depolarization and increasing the threshold for electrical excitability."
DB00869,Dorzolamide,CHEMBL218490,"Dorzolamide is a sulfonamide and a highly specific carbonic anhydrase II (CA-II) inhibitor, which is the main CA isoenzyme involved in aqueous humor secretion. Inhibition of CA-II in the ciliary processes of the eye decreases aqueous humor secretion, presumably by slowing the formation of bicarbonate ions with subsequent reduction in sodium and fluid transport. Dorzolamide also accumulates in red blood cells as a result of CA-II binding, as CA-II is found predominantly in erythrocytes. However, sufficient CA-II activity remains so that adverse effects due to systemic CA inhibition are not observed."
DB00870,Suprofen,CHEMBL956,"Suprofen binds to the cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) isoenzymes, preventing the synthesis of prostaglandins and reducing the inflammatory response. Cyclooxygenase catalyses the formation of prostaglandins and thromboxane from arachidonic acid (itself derived from the cellular phospholipid bilayer by phospholipase A<sub>2</sub>). Prostaglandins act (among other things) as messenger molecules in the process of inflammation. The overall result is a reduction in pain and inflammation in the eyes and the prevention of pupil constriction during surgery. Normally trauma to the anterior segment of the eye (especially the iris) increases endogenous prostaglandin synthesis which leads to constriction of the iris sphincter."
DB00871,Terbutaline,CHEMBL1760,"The pharmacologic effects of terbutaline are at least in part attributable to stimulation through beta-adrenergic receptors of intracellular adenyl cyclase, the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to cyclic- 3',5'- adenosine monophosphate (c-AMP). Increased c-AMP levels are associated with relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle and inhibition of release of mediators of immediate hypersensitivity from cells, especially from mast cells."
DB00872,Conivaptan,CHEMBL1755,"Conivaptan is a dual AVP antagonist with nanomolar affinity for human arginine vasopressin V<sub>1A</sub> and V<sub>2</sub> receptors <i>in vitro</i>. This antagonism occurs in the renal collecting ducts, resulting in aquaresis, or excretion of free water. "
DB00873,Loteprednol,,"Loteprednol etabonate (LE) is a ""soft"" steroid belonging to a unique class of glucocorticoids. Loteprednol etabonate is structurally similar to other glucocorticoids. However, the number 20 position ketone group is absent. It is highly lipid soluble which enhances its penetration into cells. Loteprednol etabonate is synthesized through structural modifications of prednisolone- related compounds so that it will undergo a predictable transformation to an inactive metabolite. It first binds to the type II glucocorticoid receptor. Corticosteroids inhibit the inflammatory response to a variety of inciting agents and probably delay or slow healing. They inhibit the edema, fibrin deposition, capillary dilation, leukocyte migration, capillary proliferation, fibroblast proliferation, deposition of collagen, and scar formation associated with inflammation. There is no generally accepted explanation for the mechanism of action of ocular corticosteroids. However, corticosteroids are thought to act by the induction of phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins, collectively called lipocortins. It is postulated that these proteins control the biosynthesis of potent mediators of inflammation such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes by inhibiting the release of their common precursor arachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid is released from membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A2."
DB00874,Guaifenesin,CHEMBL980,"Guaifenesin may act as an irritant to gastric vagal receptors, and recruit efferent parasympathetic reflexes that cause glandular exocytosis of a less viscous mucus mixture. Cough may be provoked. This combination may flush tenacious, congealed mucopurulent material from obstructed small airways and lead to a temporary improvement in dyspnea or the work of breathing."
DB00875,Flupentixol,CHEMBL54661,"Flupenthixol is a thioxanthene antipsychotic. The mechanism of action of Flupenthixol is not completely understood. Flupenthixol is a powerful antagonist of both D1 and D2 dopamine receptors, and an alpha-adrenergic receptor antagonist. It's antipsychotic activity is thought to be related to blocks postsynaptic dopamine receptors in the CNS."
DB00876,Eprosartan,CHEMBL813,"Eprosartan blocks the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT<sub>1</sub> receptor found in many tissues (e.g., vascular smooth muscle, adrenal gland). There is also an AT<sub>2</sub> receptor found in many tissues but it is not known to be associated with cardiovascular homeostasis. Eprosartan does not exhibit any partial agonist activity at the AT<sub>1</sub> receptor. Its affinity for the AT<sub>1</sub> receptor is 1,000 times greater than for the AT<sub>2</sub> receptor. In vitro binding studies indicate that eprosartan is a reversible, competitive inhibitor of the AT<sub>1</sub> receptor. Eprosartan has also been shown to bind to AT<sub>1</sub> receptors both presynaptically and synaptically. Its action on presynaptic AT<sub>1</sub> receptors results in the inhibition of sympathetically stimulated noradrenaline release. Unlike ACE inhibitors, eprosartan and other ARBs do not interfere with response to bradykinins and substance P, which allows for the absence of adverse effects that are present in ACE inhibitors (eg. dry cough)."
DB00877,Sirolimus,CHEMBL413,"Sirolimus inhibits T lymphocyte activation and proliferation that occurs in response to antigenic and cytokine (Interleukin IL-2, IL-4, and IL-15) stimulation by a mechanism that is distinct from that of other immunosuppressants. Sirolimus also inhibits antibody production. In cells, sirolimus binds to the immunophilin, FK Binding Protein-12 (FKBP-12), to generate an immunosuppressive complex. The sirolimus:FKBP-12 complex has no effect on calcineurin activity. This complex binds to and inhibits the activation of the mammalian Target Of Rapamycin (mTOR), a key regulatory kinase. This inhibition suppresses cytokine-driven T-cell proliferation, inhibiting the progression from the G1 to the S phase of the cell cycle."
DB00878,Chlorhexidine,CHEMBL790,"Chlorhexidine's antimicrobial effects are associated with the attractions between chlorhexidine (cation) and negatively charged bacterial cells. After chlorhexidine is absorpted onto the organism's cell wall, it disrupts the integrity of the cell membrane and causes the leakage of intracellular components of the organisms."
DB00879,Emtricitabine,CHEMBL885,"Emtricitabine works by inhibiting reverse transcriptase, the enzyme that copies HIV RNA into new viral DNA. Emtricitabine is a synthetic nucleoside analogue of cytidine. It is phosphorylated by cellular enzymes to form emtricitabine 5'-triphosphate, which is responsible for the inhibition of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase. It competes with the natural substrate deoxycytidine 5'-triphosphate and incorporates into nascent viral DNA, resulting in early chain termination. Therefore emtricitabine inhibits the activity of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) both by competing with the natural substrate deoxycytidine 5'-triphosphate and by its incorporation into viral DNA. By inhibiting HIV-1 reverse transcriptase, emtricitabine can help to lower the amount of HIV, or ""viral load"", in a patient's body and can indirectly increase the number of immune system cells (called T cells or CD4+ T-cells). Both of these changes are associated with healthier immune systems and decreased likelihood of serious illness."
DB00880,Chlorothiazide,CHEMBL842,"As a diuretic, chlorothiazide inhibits active chloride reabsorption at the early distal tubule via the Na-Cl cotransporter, resulting in an increase in the excretion of sodium, chloride, and water. Thiazides like chlorothiazide also inhibit sodium ion transport across the renal tubular epithelium through binding to the thiazide sensitive sodium-chloride transporter. This results in an increase in potassium excretion via the sodium-potassium exchange mechanism. The antihypertensive mechanism of chlorothiazide is less well understood although it may be mediated through its action on carbonic anhydrases in the smooth muscle or through its action on the large-conductance calcium-activated potassium (KCa) channel, also found in the smooth muscle."
DB00881,Quinapril,CHEMBL1592,"There are two isoforms of ACE: the somatic isoform, which exists as a glycoprotein comprised of a single polypeptide chain of 1277; and the testicular isoform, which has a lower molecular mass and is thought to play a role in sperm maturation and binding of sperm to the oviduct epithelium. Somatic ACE has two functionally active domains, N and C, which arise from tandem gene duplication. Although the two domains have high sequence similarity, they play distinct physiological roles. The C-domain is predominantly involved in blood pressure regulation while the N-domain plays a role in hematopoietic stem cell differentiation and proliferation. ACE inhibitors bind to and inhibit the activity of both domains, but have much greater affinity for and inhibitory activity against the C-domain. Quinaprilat, the principle active metabolite of quinapril, competes with ATI for binding to ACE and inhibits and enzymatic proteolysis of ATI to ATII. Decreasing ATII levels in the body decreases blood pressure by inhibiting the pressor effects of ATII as described in the Pharmacology section above. Quinaprilat also causes an increase in plasma renin activity likely due to a loss of feedback inhibition mediated by ATII on the release of renin and/or stimulation of reflex mechanisms via baroreceptors. "
DB00882,Clomifene,CHEMBL2355051,"Clomifene has both estrogenic and anti-estrogenic properties, but its precise mechanism of action has not been determined. Clomifene appears to stumulate the release of gonadotropins, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and leuteinizing hormone (LH), which leads to the development and maturation of ovarian follicle, ovulation, and subsequent development and function of the coprus luteum, thus resulting in pregnancy. Gonadotropin release may result from direct stimulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis or from a decreased inhibitory influence of estrogens on the hypothalamic-pituitary axis by competing with the endogenous estrogens of the uterus, pituitary, or hypothalamus. Clomifene has no apparent progestational, androgenic, or antrandrogenic effects and does not appear to interfere with pituitary-adrenal or pituitary-thyroid function."
DB00883,Isosorbide Dinitrate,CHEMBL6622,"Similar to other nitrites and organic nitrates, isosorbide dinitrate is converted to nitric oxide (NO), an active intermediate compound which activates the enzyme guanylate cyclase (atrial natriuretic peptide receptor A). This stimulates the synthesis of cyclic guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cGMP) which then activates a series of protein kinase-dependent phosphorylations in the smooth muscle cells, eventually resulting in the dephosphorylation of the myosin light chain of the smooth muscle fiber. The subsequent release of calcium ions results in the relaxation of the smooth muscle cells and vasodilation."
DB00884,Risedronate,CHEMBL923,"The action of risedronate on bone tissue is based partly on its affinity for hydroxyapatite, which is part of the mineral matrix of bone. Risedronate also targets farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) synthase. Nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates (such as pamidronate, alendronate, risedronate, ibandronate and zoledronate) appear to act as analogues of isoprenoid diphosphate lipids, thereby inhibiting FPP synthase, an enzyme in the mevalonate pathway. Inhibition of this enzyme in osteoclasts prevents the biosynthesis of isoprenoid lipids (FPP and GGPP) that are essential for the post-translational farnesylation and geranylgeranylation of small GTPase signalling proteins. This activity inhibits osteoclast activity and reduces bone resorption and turnover. In postmenopausal women, it reduces the elevated rate of bone turnover, leading to, on average, a net gain in bone mass."
DB00885,Pemirolast,CHEMBL1201198,"Pemirolast binds to the histamine H<sub>1</sub> receptor. This blocks the action of endogenous histamine, which subsequently leads to temporary relief of the negative symptoms brought on by histamine. Pemirolast has also been observed to inhibit antigen-stimulated calcium ion influx into mast cells through the blockage of calcium channels. Pemirolast inhibits the chemotaxis of eosinophils into ocular tissue, and prevents inflammatory mediator release from human eosinophils."
DB00886,Omapatrilat,CHEMBL289556,Omapatrilat binds to both angiotensin converting enzyme and neutral endopeptidase. This results in a decrease renin-angiotensin-aldosterone production and increase natriuretic peptidase circulation.
DB00887,Bumetanide,CHEMBL1072,"Bumetanide interferes with renal cAMP and/or inhibits the sodium-potassium ATPase pump. Bumetanide appears to block the active reabsorption of chloride and possibly sodium in the ascending loop of Henle, altering electrolyte transfer in the proximal tubule. This results in excretion of sodium, chloride, and water and, hence, diuresis."
DB00888,Mechlorethamine,CHEMBL427,"Alkylating agents work by three different mechanisms: 1) attachment of alkyl groups to DNA bases, resulting in the DNA being fragmented by repair enzymes in their attempts to replace the alkylated bases, preventing DNA synthesis and RNA transcription from the affected DNA, 2) DNA damage via the formation of cross-links (bonds between atoms in the DNA) which prevents DNA from being separated for synthesis or transcription, and 3) the induction of mispairing of the nucleotides leading to mutations. Mechlorethamine is cell cycle phase-nonspecific."
DB00889,Granisetron,CHEMBL1290003,"Granisetron is a potent, selective antagonist of 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptors. The antiemetic activity of the drug is brought about through the inhibition of 5-HT3 receptors present both centrally (medullary chemoreceptor zone) and peripherally (GI tract). This inhibition of 5-HT3 receptors in turn inhibits the visceral afferent stimulation of the vomiting center, likely indirectly at the level of the area postrema, as well as through direct inhibition of serotonin activity within the area postrema and the chemoreceptor trigger zone."
DB00890,Dienestrol,CHEMBL1018,"Dienestrol is a synthetic, non-steroidal estrogen. Estrogens passively diffuse into target cells of responsive tissues, complex with the estrogen receptors, and enter the cell's nucleus to initiate or enhance gene transcription of protein synthesis after binding to DNA."
DB00891,Sulfapyridine,CHEMBL700,"Sulfapyridine is a competitive inhibitor of the bacterial enzyme dihydropteroate synthetase. The inhibited reaction is necessary in these organisms for the synthesis of folic acid by means of processing the substrate para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA). Dihydropteroate synthetase activity is vital in the synthesis of folate, and folate is required for cells to make nucleic acids, such as DNA or RNA. So if DNA molecules cannot be built, the cell cannot divide.
"
DB00892,Oxybuprocaine,CHEMBL1200,Oxybuprocaine binds to sodium channel and reversibly stabilizes the neuronal membrane which decreases its permeability to sodium ions. Depolarization of the neuronal membrane is inhibited thereby blocking the initiation and conduction of nerve impulses.
DB00893,Iron Dextran,CHEMBL1201544,"After iron dextran is injected, the circulating iron dextran is removed from the plasma by cells of the reticuloendothelial system, which split the complex into its components of iron and dextran. The iron is immediately bound to the available protein moieties to form hemosiderin or ferritin, the physiological forms of iron, or to a lesser extent to transferrin. This iron which is subject to physiological control replenishes hemoglobin and depleted iron stores."
DB00894,Testolactone,CHEMBL1571,"Although the precise mechanism by which testolactone produces its clinical antineoplastic effects has not been established, its principal action is reported to be inhibition of steroid aromatase activity and consequent reduction in estrone synthesis from adrenal androstenedione, the major source of estrogen in postmenopausal women. Based on in vitro studies, the aromatase inhibition may be noncompetitive and irreversible. This phenomenon may account for the persistence of testolactone's effect on estrogen synthesis after drug withdrawal."
DB00895,Benzylpenicilloyl Polylysine,CHEMBL1201779,The skin test for penicillin demonstrates the presence or absence of specific IgE antibodies to major and minor penicillin determinants. IgE antibodies to major determinants can be detected by using benzylpenicilloyl polylysine. A penicillin skin test predicts only the presence of IgE antibodies for the major or minor penicillin determinants at the time of application and does not predict the future development of IgE-mediated reactions during subsequent courses of penicillin. Benzylpenicilloyl polylysine reacts specifically with penicilloyl skin sensitizing antibodies (reagins) to produce immediate wheal and flare reactions which may reflect increased risk of allergic reactions to subsequent penicillin therapy.
DB00896,Rimexolone,CHEMBL1200617,"Rimexolone is a glucocorticoid receptor agonist. The antiinflammatory actions of corticosteroids are thought to involve lipocortins, phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins which, through inhibition of arachidonic acid, control the biosynthesis of prostaglandins and leukotrienes. By binding to the glucocorticoid receptor, this drug ultimately leads to changes in genetic transcription involving the lipocortins and prostaglandins."
DB00897,Triazolam,CHEMBL646,"Benzodiazepines bind nonspecifically to bezodiazepine receptors BNZ1, which mediates sleep, and BNZ2, which affects affects muscle relaxation, anticonvulsant activity, motor coordination, and memory. As benzodiazepine receptors are thought to be coupled to gamma-aminobutyric acid-A (GABA<sub>A</sub>) receptors, this enhances the effects of GABA by increasing GABA affinity for the GABA receptor. Binding of GABA to the site opens the chloride channel, resulting in a hyperpolarized cell membrane that prevents further excitation of the cell."
DB00898,Ethanol,CHEMBL545,"Ethanol affects the brain’s neurons in several ways. It alters their membranes as well as their ion channels, enzymes, and receptors. Alcohol also binds directly to the receptors for acetylcholine, serotonin, GABA, and the NMDA receptors for glutamate. 
The sedative effects of ethanol are mediated through binding to GABA receptors and glycine receptors (alpha 1 and alpha 2 subunits). It also inhibits NMDA receptor functioning. In its role as an anti-infective, ethanol acts as an osmolyte or dehydrating agent that disrupts the osmotic balance across cell membranes."
DB00899,Remifentanil,CHEMBL1005,"Remifentanil is a &micro;-opioid agonist with rapid onset and peak effect, and short duration of action. The &micro;-opioid activity of remifentanil is antagonized by opioid antagonists such as naloxone."
DB00900,Didanosine,CHEMBL1460,"Didanosine (ddI) is metabolized intracellularly by a series of cellular enzymes to its active moiety, dideoxyadenosine triphosphate (ddATP), which inhibits the HIV reverse transcriptase enzyme competitively by competing with natural dATP. It also acts as a chain terminator by its incorporation into viral DNA as the lack of a 3'-OH group in the incorporated nucleoside analogue prevents the formation of the 5' to 3' phosphodiester linkage essential for DNA chain elongation, and therefore, the viral DNA growth is terminated."
DB00901,Bitolterol,CHEMBL1201295,Bitolterol is an adrenergic beta-2 agonist. Asthma results from a narrowing of the bronchial tubes. This narrowing is caused by muscle spasm and inflammation within the bronchial tubes. Agonism of the beta-2 adrenergic receptors by bitolterol leads to a relaxation of the smooth muscles surrounding these airway tubes which then increases the diameter and ease of air flow through the tubes.
DB00902,Methdilazine,CHEMBL1200959,"Methdilazine binds to the histamine H<sub>1</sub> receptor. This blocks the action of endogenous histamine, which subsequently leads to temporary relief of the negative symptoms brought on by histamine."
DB00903,Etacrynic acid,CHEMBL456,"Ethacrynic acid inhibits symport of sodium, potassium, and chloride primarily in the ascending limb of Henle, but also in the proximal and distal tubules. This pharmacological action results in excretion of these ions, increased urinary output, and reduction in extracellular fluid. Diuretics also lower blood pressure initially by reducing plasma and extracellular fluid volume; cardiac output also decreases, explaining its antihypertensive action. Eventually, cardiac output returns to normal with an accompanying decrease in peripheral resistance. Its mode of action does not involve carbonic anhydrase inhibition."
DB00904,Ondansetron,CHEMBL46,"Ondansetron is a selective serotonin 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor antagonist. The antiemetic activity of the drug is brought about through the inhibition of 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptors present both centrally (medullary chemoreceptor zone) and peripherally (GI tract). This inhibition of 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptors in turn inhibits the visceral afferent stimulation of the vomiting center, likely indirectly at the level of the area postrema, as well as through direct inhibition of serotonin activity within the area postrema and the chemoreceptor trigger zone."
DB00905,Bimatoprost,CHEMBL1200963,"Bimatoprost is believed to lower intraocular pressure (IOP) in humans by increasing outflow of aqueous humor through both the trabecular meshwork and uveoscleral routes. Bimatoprost reduces the pressure in the eye by mimicking the action of a naturally-occuring prostaglandin. Prostaglandins are a group of chemicals found in many places in the body. In the eye, they increase the drainage of the aqueous humour out of the eyeball. Bimatoprost is a synthetic compound related to one of the natural prostaglandins, and works by increasing the drainage of aqueous humour out of the eyeball. Bimatoprost may also lower the rate of aqueous formation in the eye. Both these effects decrease the pressure within the eye."
DB00906,Tiagabine,CHEMBL1027,"Though the exact mechanism by which Tiagabine exerts its effect on the human body is unknown, it does appear to operate as a selective GABA reuptake inhibitor."
DB00907,Cocaine,CHEMBL370805,"Cocaine produces anesthesia by inhibiting excitation of nerve endings or by blocking conduction in peripheral nerves. This is achieved by reversibly binding to and inactivating sodium channels. Sodium influx through these channels is necessary for the depolarization of nerve cell membranes and subsequent propagation of impulses along the course of the nerve. Cocaine is the only local anesthetic with vasoconstrictive properties. This is a result of its blockade of norepinephrine reuptake in the autonomic nervous system. Cocaine binds differentially to the dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine transport proteins and directly prevents the re-uptake of dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine into pre-synaptic neurons. Its effect on dopamine levels is most responsible for the addictive property of cocaine."
DB00908,Quinidine,CHEMBL1294,"Quinidine acts on sodium channels on the neuronal cell membrane, limiting the spread of seizure activity and reducing seizure propagation. The antiarrhythmic actions are mediated through effects on sodium channels in Purkinje fibers. Quinidine may also act on the slow inward calcium current (ICa), the rapid (IKr) and slow (IKs) components of the delayed potassium rectifier current, the inward potassium rectifier current (IKI), the ATP-sensitive potassium channel (IKATP) and Ito."
DB00909,Zonisamide,CHEMBL750,"Zonisamide binds to sodium channels and voltage sensitive calcium channels, which suppresses neuronal depolarization and hypersynchronization. Zonisamide also inhibits carbonic anhydrase to a weaker extent, but such an effect is not thought to contribute substantially to the drug's anticonvulsant activity."
DB00910,Paricalcitol,CHEMBL1200622,"Paricalcitol is a synthetic, biologically active vitamin D analog of calcitriol with modifications to the side chain (D2) and the A (19-nor) ring. Preclinical andin vitro studies have demonstrated that paricalcitol's biological actions are mediated through binding of the VDR, which results in the selective activation of vitamin D responsive pathways. Vitamin D and paricalcitol have been shown to reduce parathyroid hormone levels by inhibiting PTH synthesis and secretion."
DB00911,Tinidazole,CHEMBL1220,"Tinidazole is a prodrug and antiprotozoal agent. The nitro group of tinidazole is reduced in <i>Trichomonas</i> by a ferredoxin-mediated electron transport system. The free nitro radical generated as a result of this reduction is believed to be responsible for the antiprotozoal activity. It is suggested that the toxic free radicals covalently bind to DNA, causing DNA damage and leading to cell death. The mechanism by which tinidazole exhibits activity against <i>Giardia</i> and <i>Entamoeba</i> species is not known, though it is probably similar."
DB00912,Repaglinide,CHEMBL1272,"Repaglinide activity is dependent on the presence functioning &beta; cells and glucose. In contrast to sulfonylurea insulin secretatogogues, repaglinide has no effect on insulin release in the absence of glucose. Rather, it potentiates the effect of extracellular glucose on ATP-sensitive potassium channel and has little effect on insulin levels between meals and overnight. As such, repaglinide is more effective at reducing postprandial blood glucose levels than fasting blood glucose levels and requires a longer duration of therapy (approximately one month) before decreases in fasting blood glucose are observed. The insulinotropic effects of repaglinide are highest at intermediate glucose levels (3 to 10 mmol/L) and it does not increase insulin release already stimulated by high glucose concentrations (greater than 15 mmol/L). Repaglinide appears to be selective for pancreatic &beta; cells and does not appear to affect skeletal or cardiac muscle or thyroid tissue. "
DB00913,Anileridine,CHEMBL1201347,"Opiate receptors are coupled with G-protein receptors and function as both positive and negative regulators of synaptic transmission via G-proteins that activate effector proteins. Binding of the opiate stimulates the exchange of GTP for GDP on the G-protein complex. As the effector system is adenylate cyclase and cAMP located at the inner surface of the plasma membrane, opioids decrease intracellular cAMP by inhibiting adenylate cyclase. Subsequently, the release of nociceptive neurotransmitters such as substance P, GABA, dopamine, acetylcholine and noradrenaline is inhibited. Opioids also inhibit the release of vasopressin, somatostatin, insulin and glucagon. Opioids such as anileridine close N-type voltage-operated calcium channels (OP2-receptor agonist) and open calcium-dependent inwardly rectifying potassium channels (OP3 and OP1 receptor agonist). This results in hyperpolarization and reduced neuronal excitability."
DB00914,Phenformin,CHEMBL170988,"Phenformin binds to the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). AMPK is an ultra-sensitive cellular energy sensor that monitors energy consumption and down-regulates ATP-consuming processes when activated. The biguanide phenformin has been shown to independently decrease ion transport processes, influence cellular metabolism and activate AMPK. Phenformin's hypoglycemic activity is related the effect it has in activating AMPK and fooling insulin sensitive cells into thinking that insulin levels are low and causing the body to use glucose as if in a state of low caloric consumption. This drug also seems to inhibit several varients of ATP-sensitive potassium channels (namely the receptor subtype Kir6.1)."
DB00915,Amantadine,CHEMBL660,"The mechanism of its antiparkinsonic effect is not fully understood, but it appears to be releasing dopamine from the nerve endings of the brain cells, together with stimulation of norepinephrine response. It also has NMDA receptor antagonistic effects. The antiviral mechanism seems to be unrelated. The drug interferes with a viral protein, M2 (an ion channel), which is needed for the viral particle to become ""uncoated"" once it is taken inside the cell by endocytosis."
DB00916,Metronidazole,CHEMBL137,"Metronidazole is a prodrug. Unionized metronidazole is selective for anaerobic bacteria due to their ability to intracellularly reduce metronidazole to its active form. This reduced metronidazole then covalently binds to DNA, disrupt its helical structure, inhibiting bacterial nucleic acid synthesis and resulting in bacterial cell death."
DB00917,Dinoprostone,CHEMBL548,"Dinoprostone administered intravaginally stimulates the myometrium of the gravid uterus to contract in a manner that is similar to the contractions seen in the term uterus during labor, resulting in the evacuation of the products of conception from the uterus. It is believed that dinoprostone exerts its uterine effects via direct myometrial stimulation, but the exact mechanism of action is unkown. Other suggested mechanisms include the regulation of cellular membrane calcium transport and of intracellular concentrations of cyclic 3',5'-adenosine monophosphate. Dinoprostone also appears to produce local cervical effects including softening, effacement, and dilation. The exact mechanism of action for this effect is also unknown, but it has been suggested that this effect may be associated with collagen degradation caused by secretion of the enzyme collagenase as a partial response to locally administered dinoprostone."
DB00918,Almotriptan,CHEMBL1505,Almotriptan binds with high affinity to human 5-HT<sub>1B</sub> and 5-HT<sub>1D</sub> receptors leading to cranial blood vessel constriction.
DB00919,Spectinomycin,CHEMBL1167,Spectinomycin is an inhibitor of protein synthesis in the bacterial cell; the site of action is the 30S ribosomal subunit. It is bactericidal in its action.
DB00920,Ketotifen,CHEMBL534,"Ketotifen is a relatively selective, non-competitive histamine antagonist (H1-receptor) and mast cell stabilizer. Ketotifen inhibits the release of mediators from mast cells involved in hypersensitivity reactions. Decreased chemotaxis and activation of eosinophils have also been demonstrated. Ketotifen also inhibits cAMP phosphodiesterase. Properties of ketotifen which may contribute to its antiallergic activity and its ability to affect the underlying pathology of asthma include inhibition of the development of airway hyper-reactivity associated with activation of platelets by PAF (Platelet Activating Factor), inhibition of PAF-induced accumulation of eosinophils and platelets in the airways, suppression of the priming of eosinophils by human recombinant cytokines and antagonism of bronchoconstriction due to leukotrienes. Ketotifen inhibits of the release of allergic mediators such as histamine, leukotrienes C4 and D4(SRS-A) and PAF."
DB00921,Buprenorphine,CHEMBL560511,"Buprenorphine's analgesic effect is due to partial agonist activity at mu-opioid receptors. Buprenorphine is also a kappa-opioid receptor antagonist. The partial agonist activity means that opioid receptor antagonists (e.g., an antidote such as naloxone) only partially reverse the effects of buprenorphine. The binding to the mu and kappa receptors results in hyperpolarization and reduced neuronal excitability. Furthermore, buprenorphine slowly dissociates from its receptor. This observation would account for the longer duration of action compared to morphine, the unpredictability of its reversal by opioid antagonists, and its low level of manifest physical dependence. Its receptor fixation half life is 40 minutes which is significantly longer than morphine (milliseconds). "
DB00922,Levosimendan,CHEMBL2051955,"Levosimendan appears to increase myofilament calcium sensitivity by binding to cardiac troponin C in a calcium-dependent manner. This stabilizes the calcium-induced conformational change of troponin C, thereby (1) changing actin-myosin cross-bridge kinetics apparently without increasing the cycling rate of the cross-bridges or myocardial ATP consumption, (2) increasing the effects of calcium on cardiac myofilaments during systole and (3) improving contraction at low energy cost (inotropic effect). Calcium concentration and, therefore, sensitization decline during diastole, allowing normal or improved diastolic relaxation. Levosimendan also leads to vasodilation through the opening of ATP-sensitive potassium channels. By these inotropic and vasodilatory actions, levosimendan increases cardiac output without increasing myocardial oxygen demand. Levosimendan also has a selective phosphodiesterase (PDE)-III inhibitory action that may contribute to the inotropic effect of this compound under certain experimental conditions. It has been reported that levosimendan may act preferentially as a Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitizer at lower concentrations, whereas at higher concentrations its action as a PDE-III inhibitor becomes more prominent in experimental animals and humans."
DB00923,Ceforanide,CHEMBL1201046,The bactericidal activity of ceforanide results from the inhibition of cell wall synthesis via affinity for penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs).
DB00924,Cyclobenzaprine,CHEMBL669,"Like other tricyclic antidepressants, cyclobenzaprine exhibits anticholinergic activity, potentiation of norepinephrine, and antagonism of reserpine. Cyclobenzaprine does not directly act on the neuromuscular junction or the muscle but relieves muscle spasms through a central action, possibly at the brain stem level. Cyclobenzaprine binds to the serotonin receptor and is considered a 5-HT2 receptor antagonist that reduces muscle tone by decreasing the activity of descending serotonergic neurons."
DB00925,Phenoxybenzamine,CHEMBL753,"Phenoxybenzamine produces its therapeutic actions by blocking alpha receptors, leading to a muscle relaxation and a widening of the blood vessels. This widening of the blood vessels results in a lowering of blood pressure."
DB00926,Etretinate,CHEMBL464,"The mechanism of action of the active metabolite, acitretin, is unknown, however it is believed to work by targeting specific receptors (retinoid receptors) in the skin which help normalize the growth cycle of skin cells."
DB00927,Famotidine,CHEMBL902,"Famotidine binds competitively to H<sub>2</sub>-receptors located on the basolateral membrane of the parietal cell, blocking histamine affects. This competitive inhibition results in reduced basal and nocturnal gastric acid secretion and a reduction in gastric volume, acidity, and amount of gastric acid released in response to stimuli including food, caffeine, insulin, betazole, or pentagastrin."
DB00928,Azacitidine,CHEMBL1489,"Azacitidine (5-azacytidine) is a chemical analogue of the cytosine nucleoside used in DNA and RNA. Azacitidine is thought to induce antineoplastic activity via two mechanisms; inhibition of DNA methyltransferase at low doses, causing hypomethylation of DNA, and direct cytotoxicity in abnormal hematopoietic cells in the bone marrow through its incorporation into DNA and RNA at high doses, resulting in cell death. As azacitidine is a ribonucleoside, it incoporates into RNA to a larger extent than into DNA. The incorporation into RNA leads to the dissembly of polyribosomes, defective methylation and acceptor function of transfer RNA, and inhibition of the production of protein. Its incorporation into DNA leads to a covalent binding with DNA methyltransferases, which prevents DNA synthesis and subsequent cytotoxicity."
DB00929,Misoprostol,CHEMBL606,"Misoprostol seems to inhibit gastric acid secretion by a direct action on the parietal cells through binding to the prostaglandin receptor. The activity of this receptor is mediated by G proteins which normally activate adenylate cyclase. The indirect inhibition of adenylate cyclase by Misoprostol may be dependent on guanosine-5&rsquo;-triphosphate (GTP). The significant cytoprotective actions of misoprostol are related to several mechanisms. These include: 1. Increased secretion of bicarbonate, 2. Considerable decrease in the volume and pepsin content of the gastric secretions, 3. It prevents harmful agents from disrupting the tight junctions between the epithelial cells which stops the subsequent back diffusion of H<sup>+</sup> ions into the gastric mucosa, 4. Increased thickness of mucus layer, 5. Enhanced mucosal blood flow as a result of direct vasodilatation, 6. Stabilization of tissue lysozymes/vascular endothelium, 7. Improvement of mucosal regeneration capacity, and 8. Replacement of prostaglandins that have been depleted as a result of various insults to the area. 
Misoprostol has also been shown to increase the amplitude and frequency of uterine contractions during pregnancy via selective binding to the EP-2/EP-3 prostanoid receptors. "
DB00930,Colesevelam,,"Colesevelam is a non-absorbed, lipid-lowering polymer that binds bile acids in the intestine, impeding their reabsorption. As the bile acid pool becomes depleted, the hepatic enzyme, cholesterol 7-(alpha)-hydroxylase, is upregulated, which increases the conversion of cholesterol to bile acids. This causes an increased demand for cholesterol in the liver cells, resulting in the dual effect of increasing transcription and activity of the cholesterol biosynthetic enzyme, hydroxymethyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, and increasing the number of hepatic low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors. These compensatory effects result in increased clearance of LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) from the blood, resulting in decreased serum LDL-C levels. Serum triglyceride levels may increase or remain unchanged. The end result is increased clearance of LDL-cholesterol from the blood with decreased serum LDL-cholesterol."
DB00931,Methacycline,CHEMBL249837,"Methacycline, a tetracycline antibiotic, is a protein synthesis inhibitors, inhibiting the binding of aminoacyl-tRNA to the mRNA-ribosome complex. Methacycline inhibits cell growth by inhibiting translation. It binds to the 16S part of the 30S ribosomal subunit and prevents the amino-acyl tRNA from binding to the A site of the ribosome. The binding is reversible in nature. Tetracyclines also have been found to inhibit matrix metalloproteinases. This mechanism does not add to their antibiotic effects, but has led to extensive research on chemically modified tetracyclines or CMTs (like incyclinide) for the treatmet of rosacea, acne, and various types of neoplasms."
DB00932,Tipranavir,CHEMBL222559,"Tipranavir (TPV) is a non-peptidic HIV-1 protease inhibitor that inhibits the processing of the viral Gag and Gag-Pol polyproteins in HIV-1 infected cells, thus preventing formation of mature virions. Two mechanisms are suggested in regards to the potency of tipranavir: 1. Tipravanir may bind to the active site of the protease enzyme with fewer hydrogen bonds than peptidic protease inhibitors, which results in increased flexibility, allowing it to fit into the active site of the enzyme in viruses that have become resistance to other protease inhibitors. This also enables tipranavir to adjust to amino acid substitutions at the active site. 2. Tipranavir's strong hydrogen bonding interaction with the amide backbone of the protease active site Asp30 may lead to its activity against resistant viruses."
DB00933,Mesoridazine,CHEMBL1088,"Based upon animal studies, mesoridazine, as with other phenothiazines, acts indirectly on reticular formation, whereby neuronal activity into reticular formation is reduced without affecting its intrinsic ability to activate the cerebral cortex. In addition, the phenothiazines exhibit at least part of their activities through depression of hypothalamic centers. Neurochemically, the phenothiazines are thought to exert their effects by a central adrenergic blocking action."
DB00934,Maprotiline,CHEMBL21731,"Maprotiline exerts its antidepressant action by inhibition of presynaptic uptake of catecholamines, thereby increasing their concentration at the synaptic clefts of the brain. In single doses, the effect of maprotiline on the EEG revealed a rise in the alpha-wave density, a reduction of the alpha-wave frequency and an increase in the alpha-wave amplitude. However, as with other tricyclic antidepressants, maprotiline lowers the convulsive threshold. Maprotiline acts as an antagonist at central presynaptic &alpha;<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic inhibitory autoreceptors and hetero-receptors, an action that is postulated to result in an increase in central noradrenergic and serotonergic activity. Maprotiline is also a moderate peripheral &alpha;<sub>1</sub> adrenergic antagonist, which may explain the occasional orthostatic hypotension reported in association with its use. Maprotiline also inhibits the amine transporter, delaying the reuptake of noradrenaline and norepinephrine. Lastly, maprotiline is a strong inhibitor of the histamine H<sub>1</sub> receptor, which explains its sedative actions."
DB00935,Oxymetazoline,CHEMBL762,"Oxymetazoline is a direct acting sympathomimetic amine, which acts on alpha-adrenergic receptors in the arterioles of the conjunctiva and nasal mucosa. It produces vasoconstriction, resulting in decreased conjunctival congestion in ophthalmic. In nasal it produces constriction, resulting in decreased blood flow and decreased nasal congestion."
DB00936,Salicylic acid,CHEMBL424,"Salicylic acid directly and irreversibly inhibits the activity of both types of cyclo-oxygenases (COX-1 and COX-2) to decrease the formation of precursors of prostaglandins and thromboxanes from arachidonic acid.  Salicylate may competitively inhibit prostaglandin formation. Salicylate's antirheumatic (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory) actions are a result of its analgesic and anti-inflammatory mechanisms. Salicylic acid is a key ingredient in many skin-care products for the treatment of acne, psoriasis, calluses, corns, keratosis pilaris, and warts. It works by causing the cells of the epidermis to slough off more readily, preventing pores from clogging up, and allowing room for new cell growth. Because of its effect on skin cells, salicylic acid is used in several shampoos used to treat dandruff. Salicylic acid is also used as an active ingredient in gels which remove verrucas (plantar warts). Salicylic acid inhibits the oxidation of uridine-5-diphosphoglucose (UDPG) competitively with nicotinamide adenosine dinucleotide (NAD) and noncompetitively with UDPG. It also competitively inhibits the transferring of glucuronyl group of uridine-5-phosphoglucuronic acid (UDPGA) to the phenolic acceptor. The wound-healing retardation action of salicylates is probably due mainly to its inhibitory action on mucopolysaccharide synthesis."
DB00937,Diethylpropion,CHEMBL1194666,"Diethylpropion is an amphetamine that stimulates neurons to release or maintain high levels of a particular group of neurotransmitters known as catecholamines; these include dopamine and norepinephrine. High levels of these catecholamines tend to suppress hunger signals and appetite. Diethylpropion (through catecholamine elevation) may also indirectly affect leptin levels in the brain. It is theorized that diethylpropion can raise levels of leptin which signal satiety. It is also theorized that increased levels of the catecholamines are partially responsible for halting another chemical messenger known as neuropeptide Y. This peptide initiates eating, decreases energy expenditure, and increases fat storage."
DB00938,Salmeterol,CHEMBL1263,"Salmeterol's long, lipophilic side chain binds to exosites near beta(2)-receptors in the lungs and on bronchiolar smooth muscle, allowing the active portion of the molecule to remain at the receptor site, continually binding and releasing. Beta(2)-receptor stimulation in the lung causes relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle, bronchodilation, and increased bronchial airflow."
DB00939,Meclofenamic acid,CHEMBL509,"The mode of action, like that of other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, is not known. Therapeutic action does not result from pituitary-adrenal stimulation. In animal studies, meclofenamic acid was found to inhibit prostaglandin synthesis and to compete for binding at the prostaglandin receptor site. In vitro meclofenamic acid was found to be an inhibitor of human leukocyte 5-lipoxygenase activity. These properties may be responsible for the anti-inflammatory action of meclofenamic acid. There is no evidence that meclofenamic acid alters the course of the underlying disease."
DB00940,Methantheline,CHEMBL1201264,"Methantheline inhibits the muscarinic actions of acetylcholine on structures innervated by postganglionic cholinergic nerves as well as on smooth muscles that respond to acetylcholine but lack cholinergic innervation. These postganglionic receptor sites are present in the autonomic effector cells of the smooth muscle, cardiac muscle, sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes, and exocrine glands. Depending on the dose, anticholinergics may reduce the motility and secretory activity of the gastrointestinal system, and the tone of the ureter and urinary bladder and may have a slight relaxant action on the bile ducts and gallbladder."
DB00941,Hexafluronium,CHEMBL1201349,"Hexafluronium bromide is a non-competitive reversible inhibitor of human plasma cholinesterase or pseudocholinesterase.
Hexafluornium probably binds to anionic side receptors near the active center, causing a conformational change in the enzyme, preventing acylation of the esteratic site. The esteratic site on cholistereases is where acetylcholine is hydrolyzed to acetic acid and choline. 
"
DB00942,Cycrimine,CHEMBL1201227,"Cycrimine binds the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M1, effectively inhibiting acetylcholine. This decrease in acetylcholine restores the normal dopamine-acetylcholine balance and relieves the symptoms of Parkinson's disease."
DB00943,Zalcitabine,CHEMBL853,"Zalcitabine is a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) with activity against Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 (HIV-1). Within cells, zalcitabine is converted to its active metabolite, dideoxycytidine 5'-triphosphate (ddCTP), by the sequential action of cellular enzymes. ddCTP interferes with viral RNA-directed DNA polymerase (reverse transcriptase) by competing for utilization of the natural substrate deoxycytidine 5'-triphosphate (dCTP), as well as incorpating into viral DNA. Due to it's lack of a 3'-OH group, the formation of a 5' to 3' phosphodiester linkage that is necessary for DNA chain elongation is inhibited, thus leading to the termination of viral DNA growth."
DB00944,Demecarium,CHEMBL1201229,"Demecarium is an indirect-acting parasympathomimetic agent, also known as a cholinesterase inhibitor and anticholinesterase. Cholinesterase inhibitors prolong the effect of acetylcholine, which is released at the neuroeffector junction of parasympathetic postganglion nerves, by inactivating the cholinesterases that break it down. Demecarium inactivates both pseudocholinesterase and acetylcholinesterase. In the eye, this causes constriction of the iris sphincter muscle (causing miosis) and the ciliary muscle (affecting the accommodation reflex and causing a spasm of the focus to near vision). The outflow of the aqueous humor is facilitated, which leads to a reduction in intraocular pressure. Of the two actions, the effect on the accommodation reflex is the more transient and generally disappears before termination of the miosis."
DB00945,Acetylsalicylic acid,CHEMBL25,"The analgesic, antipyretic, and anti-inflammatory effects of acetylsalicylic acid are due to actions by both the acetyl and the salicylate portions of the intact molecule as well as by the active salicylate metabolite. Acetylsalicylic acid directly and irreversibly inhibits the activity of both types of cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and COX-2) to decrease the formation of precursors of prostaglandins and thromboxanes from arachidonic acid. This makes acetylsalicylic acid different from other NSAIDS (such as diclofenac and ibuprofen) which are reversible inhibitors. Salicylate may competitively inhibit prostaglandin formation. Acetylsalicylic acid's antirheumatic (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory) actions are a result of its analgesic and anti-inflammatory mechanisms; the therapeutic effects are not due to pituitary-adrenal stimulation. The platelet aggregation-inhibiting effect of acetylsalicylic acid specifically involves the compound's ability to act as an acetyl donor to cyclooxygenase; the nonacetylated salicylates have no clinically significant effect on platelet aggregation. Irreversible acetylation renders cyclooxygenase inactive, thereby preventing the formation of the aggregating agent thromboxane A2 in platelets. Since platelets lack the ability to synthesize new proteins, the effects persist for the life of the exposed platelets (7-10 days). Acetylsalicylic acid may also inhibit production of the platelet aggregation inhibitor, prostacyclin (prostaglandin I2), by blood vessel endothelial cells; however, inhibition prostacyclin production is not permanent as endothelial cells can produce more cyclooxygenase to replace the non-functional enzyme."
DB00946,Phenprocoumon,CHEMBL1465,"Phenprocoumon inhibits vitamin K reductase, resulting in depletion of the reduced form of vitamin K (vitamin KH2). As vitamin K is a cofactor for the carboxylation of glutamate residues on the N-terminal regions of vitamin K-dependent proteins, this limits the gamma-carboxylation and subsequent activation of the vitamin K-dependent coagulant proteins. The synthesis of vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors II, VII, IX, and X and anticoagulant proteins C and S is inhibited. Depression of three of the four vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors (factors II, VII, and X) results in decreased prothrombin levels and a decrease in the amount of thrombin generated and bound to fibrin. This reduces the thrombogenicity of clots."
DB00947,Fulvestrant,CHEMBL1712246,"Fulvestrant competitively and reversibly binds to estrogen receptors present in cancer cells and achieves its anti-estrogen effects through two separate mechanisms. First, fulvestrant binds to the receptors and downregulates them so that estrogen is no longer able to bind to these receptors. Second, fulvestrant degrades the estrogen receptors to which it is bound. Both of these mechanisms inhibit the growth of tamoxifen-resistant as well as estrogen-sensitive human breast cancer cell lines."
DB00948,Mezlocillin,CHEMBL1731,"By binding to specific penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) located inside the bacterial cell wall, mezlocillin inhibits the third and last stage of bacterial cell wall synthesis. Cell lysis is then mediated by bacterial cell wall autolytic enzymes such as autolysins; it is possible that mezlocillin interferes with an autolysin inhibitor."
DB00949,Felbamate,CHEMBL1094,"The mechanism by which felbamate exerts its anticonvulsant activity is unknown, but in animal test systems designed to detect anticonvulsant activity, felbamate has properties in common with other marketed anticonvulsants. <i>In vitro</i> receptor binding studies suggest that felbamate may be an antagonist at the strychnine-insensitive glycine-recognition site of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-ionophore complex. Antagonism of the NMDA receptor glycine binding site may block the effects of the excitatory amino acids and suppress seizure activity. Animal studies indicate that felbamate may increase the seizure threshold and may decrease seizure spread. It is also indicated that felbamate has weak inhibitory effects on GABA-receptor binding, benzodiazepine receptor binding."
DB00950,Fexofenadine,CHEMBL914,"Like other H1-blockers, Fexofenadine competes with free histamine for binding at H1-receptors in the GI tract, large blood vessels, and bronchial smooth muscle. This blocks the action of endogenous histamine, which subsequently leads to temporary relief of the negative symptoms (eg. nasal congestion, watery eyes) brought on by histamine. Fexofenadine exhibits no anticholinergic, antidopaminergic, alpha1-adrenergic or beta-adrenergic-receptor blocking effects."
DB00951,Isoniazid,CHEMBL64,"Isoniazid is a prodrug and must be activated by bacterial catalase. Specficially, activation is associated with reduction of the mycobacterial ferric KatG catalase-peroxidase by hydrazine and reaction with oxygen to form an oxyferrous enzyme complex. Once activated, isoniazid inhibits the synthesis of mycoloic acids, an essential component of the bacterial cell wall. At therapeutic levels isoniazid is bacteriocidal against actively growing intracellular and extracellular <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> organisms. Specifically isoniazid inhibits InhA, the enoyl reductase from <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i>, by forming a covalent adduct with the NAD cofactor. It is the INH-NAD adduct that acts as a slow, tight-binding competitive inhibitor of InhA."
DB00952,Naratriptan,CHEMBL1278,"Three distinct pharmacological actions have been implicated in the antimigraine effect of the triptans: (1) stimulation of presynaptic 5-HT1D receptors, which serves to inhibit both dural vasodilation and inflammation; (2) direct inhibition of trigeminal nuclei cell excitability via 5-HT1B/1D receptor agonism in the brainstem and (3) vasoconstriction of meningeal, dural, cerebral or pial vessels as a result of vascular 5-HT1B receptor agonism."
DB00953,Rizatriptan,CHEMBL905,"Three distinct pharmacological actions have been implicated in the antimigraine effect of the triptans: (1) stimulation of presynaptic 5-HT1D receptors, which serves to inhibit both dural vasodilation and inflammation; (2) direct inhibition of trigeminal nuclei cell excitability via 5-HT1B/1D receptor agonism in the brainstem and (3) vasoconstriction of meningeal, dural, cerebral or pial vessels as a result of vascular 5-HT1B receptor agonism."
DB00954,Dirithromycin,CHEMBL1237072,"Dirithromycin prevents bacteria from growing, by interfering with their protein synthesis. Dirithromycin binds to the 50S subunit of the 70S bacterial ribosome, and thus inhibits the translocation of peptides. Dirithromycin has over 10 times higher affinity to the subunit 50S than erythromycin. In addition, dirithromycin binds simultaneously in to two domains of 23S RNA of the ribosomal subunit 50S, where older macrolides bind only in one. Dirithromycin can also inhibit the formation of ribosomal subunits 50S and 30S."
DB00955,Netilmicin,CHEMBL1572,"Aminoglycosides like netilmicin ""irreversibly"" bind to specific 30S-subunit proteins and 16S rRNA. Specifically netilmicin binds to four nucleotides of 16S rRNA and a single amino acid of protein S12. This interferes with decoding site in the vicinity of nucleotide 1400 in 16S rRNA of 30S subunit. This region interacts with the wobble base in the anticodon of tRNA. This leads to interference with the initiation complex, misreading of mRNA so incorrect amino acids are inserted into the polypeptide leading to nonfunctional or toxic peptides and the breakup of polysomes into nonfunctional monosomes, leaving the bacterium unable to synthesize proteins vital to its growth."
DB00956,Hydrocodone,CHEMBL1457,"Hydrocodone acts as a weak agonist at OP1, OP2, and OP3 opiate receptors within the central nervous system (CNS). Hydrocodone primarily affects OP3 receptors, which are coupled with G-protein receptors and function as modulators, both positive and negative, of synaptic transmission via G-proteins that activate effector proteins. Binding of the opiate stimulates the exchange of GTP for GDP on the G-protein complex. As the effector system is adenylate cyclase and cAMP located at the inner surface of the plasma membrane, opioids decrease intracellular cAMP by inhibiting adenylate cyclase. Subsequently, the release of nociceptive neurotransmitters such as substance P, GABA, dopamine, acetylcholine, and noradrenaline is inhibited. Opioids such as hydrocodone also inhibit the release of vasopressin, somatostatin, insulin, and glucagon. Opioids close N-type voltage-operated calcium channels (OP2-receptor agonist) and open calcium-dependent inwardly rectifying potassium channels (OP3 and OP1 receptor agonist). This results in hyperpolarization and reduced neuronal excitability."
DB00957,Norgestimate,CHEMBL1200934,"Norgestimate binds to androgen and progestogen receptors. Target cells include the female reproductive tract, the mammary gland, the hypothalamus, and the pituitary. Once bound to the receptor, progestins like Norgestimate will slow the frequency of release of gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) from the hypothalamus and blunt the pre-ovulatory LH (luteinizing hormone) surge."
DB00958,Carboplatin,CHEMBL1351,"Alkylating agents work by three different mechanisms: 1) attachment of alkyl groups to DNA bases, resulting in the DNA being fragmented by repair enzymes in their attempts to replace the alkylated bases, preventing DNA synthesis and RNA transcription from the affected DNA, 2) DNA damage via the formation of cross-links (bonds between atoms in the DNA) which prevents DNA from being separated for synthesis or transcription, and 3) the induction of mispairing of the nucleotides leading to mutations."
DB00959,Methylprednisolone,CHEMBL650,"Unbound glucocorticoids cross cell membranes and bind with high affinity to specific cytoplasmic receptors, modifying transcription and protein synthesis. By this mechanism, glucocorticoids can inhibit leukocyte infiltration at the site of inflammation, interfere with mediators of inflammatory response, and suppress humoral immune responses. The antiinflammatory actions of corticosteroids are thought to involve phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins, lipocortins, which control the biosynthesis of potent mediators of inflammation such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes."
DB00960,Pindolol,CHEMBL500,"Pindolol non-selectively blocks beta-1 adrenergic receptors mainly in the heart, inhibiting the effects of epinephrine and norepinephrine resulting in a decrease in heart rate and blood pressure. By binding beta-2 receptors in the juxtaglomerular apparatus, Pindolol inhibits the production of renin, thereby inhibiting angiotensin II and aldosterone production and therefore inhibits the vasoconstriction and water retention due to angiotensin II and aldosterone, respectively."
DB00961,Mepivacaine,CHEMBL1087,"Local anesthetics block the generation and the conduction of nerve impulses, presumably by increasing the threshold for electrical excitation in the nerve, by slowing the propagation of the nerve impulse, and by reducing the rate of rise of the action potential. In general, the progression of anesthesia is related to the diameter, myelination, and conduction velocity of affected nerve fibers. Clinically, the order of loss of nerve function is as follows: pain, temperature, touch, proprioception, and skeletal muscle tone."
DB00962,Zaleplon,CHEMBL1521,Zaleplon exerts its action through subunit modulation of the GABA<sub>B</sub>Z receptor chloride channel macromolecular complex. Zaleplon also binds selectively to the brain omega-1 receptor located on the alpha subunit of the GABA-A/chloride ion channel receptor complex and potentiates t-butyl-bicyclophosphorothionate (TBPS) binding.
DB00963,Bromfenac,CHEMBL1077,"The mechanism of its action is thought to be due to its ability to block prostaglandin synthesis by inhibiting cyclooxygenase 1 and 2. Prostaglandins have been shown in many animal models to be mediators of certain kinds of intraocular inflammation. In studies performed in animal eyes, prostaglandins have been shown to produce disruption of the blood-aqueous humor barrier, vasodilation, increased vascular permeability, leukocytosis, and increased intraocular pressure."
DB00964,Apraclonidine,CHEMBL647,"Apraclonidine is a relatively selective alpha2 adrenergic receptor agonist that stimulates alpha1 receptors to a lesser extent. It has a peak ocular hypotensive effect occurring at two hours post-dosing. The exact mechanism of action is unknown, but fluorophotometric studies in animals and humans suggest that Apraclonidine has a dual mechanism of action by reducing aqueous humor production through the constriction of afferent ciliary process vessels, and increasing uveoscleral outflow."
DB00965,Ethiodized oil,CHEMBL1201458,"Ethiodized oil is selectively retained in tumor vessels for long periods, and is used for imaging organs such as liver, lung, stomach, and thyroid. Labeled with I-131 or other beta emitters (Y-90 or P-32), ethiodized oil can deliver a high internal radiation dose to certain tumors with minimal effect on healthy tissues."
DB00966,Telmisartan,CHEMBL1017,"Telmisartan interferes with the binding of angiotensin II to the angiotensin II AT<sub>1</sub>-receptor by binding reversibly and selectively to the receptors in vascular smooth muscle and the adrenal gland. As angiotensin II is a vasoconstrictor, which also stimulates the synthesis and release of aldosterone, blockage of its effects results in decreases in systemic vascular resistance. Telmisartan does not inhibit the angiotensin converting enzyme, other hormone receptors, or ion channels. Studies also suggest that telmisartan is a partial agonist of PPAR&gamma;, which is an established target for antidiabetic drugs. This suggests that telmisartan can improve carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, as well as control insulin resistance without causing the side effects that are associated with full PPAR&gamma; activators."
DB00967,Desloratadine,CHEMBL1172,"Like other H1-blockers, Desloratadine competes with free histamine for binding at H<sub>1</sub>-receptors in the GI tract, uterus, large blood vessels, and bronchial smooth muscle. This blocks the action of endogenous histamine, which subsequently leads to temporary relief of the negative symptoms (eg. nasal congestion, watery eyes) brought on by histamine."
DB00968,Methyldopa,CHEMBL459,"Although the mechanism of action has yet to be conclusively demonstrated, the resultant hypotensive effect is most likely due to the drug's action on the CNS. Methyldopa is converted into the metabolite, alpha-methylnorepinephrine, in the CNS, where it stimulates the central inhibitory alpha-adrenergic receptors, leading to a reduction in sympathetic tone, total peripheral resistance, and blood pressure. Reduction in plasma renin activity, as well as the inhibition of both central and peripheral norepinephrine and serotonine production may also contribute to the drug's antihypertensive effect, although this is not a major mechanism of action. This is done through the inhibition of the decarboxylation of dihydroxyphenylalanine (dopa)—the precursor of norepinephrine—and of 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP)—the precursor of serotonin—in the CNS and in most peripheral tissues."
DB00969,Alosetron,CHEMBL1110,"Alosetron is a potent and selective 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor antagonist. 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptors are nonselective cation channels that are extensively distributed on enteric neurons in the human gastrointestinal tract, as well as other peripheral and central locations. Activation of these channels and the resulting neuronal depolarization affect the regulation of visceral pain, colonic transit and gastrointestinal secretions, processes that relate to the pathophysiology of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor antagonists such as alosetron inhibit activation of non-selective cation channels which results in the modulation of serotonin-sensitive GI motor and sensory processes."
DB00970,Dactinomycin,CHEMBL1554,"Good evidence exists that this drug bind strongly, but reversibly, to DNA, interfering with synthesis of RNA (prevention of RNA polymerase elongation) and, consequently, with protein synthesis."
DB00971,Selenium Sulfide,CHEMBL1200680,"Topical selenium sulfide may act by an antimitotic action, resulting in a reduction in the turnover of epidermal cells. It also has local irritant, antibacterial, and mild antifungal activity, which may contribute to its effectiveness. An antimitotic mechanism of action is suggested by data showing that selenium sulfide decreases the rate of incorporation of radioactively labeled thymidine into the DNA of dermal epithelial cells. The following organisms are generally considered susceptible to selenium sulfide in vitro: <i>Malassezia furfur</i>, <i>Microsporum sp.</i> including <i>Microsporum audouinii</i> and <i>Microsporum canis</i>, <i>Pityrosporon sp.</i>, <i>Trichophyton sp.</i> including <i>Trichophyton schoenleinii</i> and <i>Trichophyton tonsurans</i>. Selenium sulfide has been shown to be sporicidal to <i>T. tonsurans</i>, the most common etiologic agent of tinea capitis. One in-vitro study demonstrated that 2.5% selenium sulfide was equivalent in sporicidal activity to both 1% and 2% zinc pyrithione."
DB00972,Azelastine,CHEMBL639,Azelastine competes with histamine for the H1-receptor sites on effector cells and acts as an antagonist by inhibiting the release of histamine and other mediators involved in the allergic response. 
DB00973,Ezetimibe,CHEMBL1138,Ezetimibe localizes and appears to act at the brush border of the small intestine and inhibits the absorption of cholesterol. This leads to a decrease in the delivery of intestinal cholesterol to the liver.
DB00974,Edetic Acid,CHEMBL858,"The pharmacologic effects of edetate calcium disodium are due to the formation of chelates with divalent and trivalent metals. A stable chelate will form with any metal that has the ability to displace calcium from the molecule, a feature shared by lead, zinc, cadmium, manganese, iron and mercury. The amounts of manganese and iron metabolized are not significant. Copper is not mobilized and mercury is unavailable for chelation because it is too tightly bound to body ligands or it is stored in inaccessible body compartments. The excretion of calcium by the body is not increased following intravenous administration of edetate calcium disodium, but the excretion of zinc is considerably increased."
DB00975,Dipyridamole,CHEMBL932,"Dipyridamole likely inhibits both adenosine deaminase and phosphodiesterase, preventing the degradation of cAMP, an inhibitor of platelet function. This elevation in cAMP blocks the release of arachidonic acid from membrane phospholipids and reduces thromboxane A2 activity. Dipyridamole also directly stimulates the release of prostacyclin, which induces adenylate cyclase activity, thereby raising the intraplatelet concentration of cAMP and further inhibiting platelet aggregation."
DB00976,Telithromycin,CHEMBL1136,"Telithromycin acts by binding to domains II and V of 23S rRNA of the 50S ribosomal subunit. By binding at domain II, telithromycin retains activity against gram-positive cocci (e.g. Streptococcus pneumoniae) in the presence of resistance mediated by methylases (erm genes) that alter the binding site at domain V. Telithromycin may also inhibit the assembly of nascent ribosomal units. Compared to erythromycin A, telithromycin binds to the 23S rRNA with 10 times greater affinity in erythromycin-susceptible organisms and 25 times greater affinity in macrolide-resistant strains. This increased binding affinity may be conferred by the C11-12 carbamate side chain of telithromycin. The  side chain appears to maintain binding at domain II in the presence of resistance mediated by alterations in domain V. "
DB00977,Ethinyl Estradiol,CHEMBL691,"Estrogens diffuse into their target cells and interact with a protein receptor. Target cells include the female reproductive tract, the mammary gland, the hypothalamus, and the pituitary. Estrogens increase the hepatic synthesis of sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), thyroid-binding globulin (TBG), and other serum proteins and suppress follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) from the anterior pituitary. This cascade is initiated by initially binding to the estrogen receptors. The combination of an estrogen with a progestin suppresses the hypothalamic-pituitary system, decreasing the secretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH)."
DB00978,Lomefloxacin,CHEMBL561,"Lomefloxacin is a bactericidal fluoroquinolone agent with activity against a wide range of gram-negative and gram-positive organisms. The bactericidal action of lomefloxacin results from interference with the activity of the bacterial enzymes DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV, which are needed for the transcription and replication of bacterial DNA. DNA gyrase appears to be the primary quinolone target for gram-negative bacteria. Topoisomerase IV appears to be the preferential target in gram-positive organisms. Interference with these two topoisomerases results in strand breakage of the bacterial chromosome, supercoiling, and resealing. As a result DNA replication and transcription is inhibited."
DB00979,Cyclopentolate,CHEMBL1201338,"By blocking muscarinic receptors, cyclopentolate produces dilatation of the pupil (mydriasis) and prevents the eye from accommodating for near vision (cycloplegia)."
DB00980,Ramelteon,CHEMBL1218,"Ramelteon is a melatonin receptor agonist with both high affinity for melatonin MT<sub>1</sub> and MT<sub>2</sub> receptors, and lower selectivity for the MT<sub>3</sub> receptor.  Melatonin production is concurrent with nocturnal sleep, meaning that an increase in melatonin levels is related to the onset of self-reported sleepiness and an increase in sleep propensity. MT<sub>1</sub> receptors are believed to be responsible for regulation of sleepiness and facilitation of sleep onset, and MT<sub>2</sub> receptors are believed to mediate phase-shifting effects of melatonin on the circadian rhythm. While MT<sub>1</sub> and MT<sub>2</sub> receptors are associated with the sleep-wake cycle, MT<sub>3</sub> has a completely different profile, and therefore is not likely to be involved in the sleep-wake cycle. Remelteon has no appreciable affinity for the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor complex or receptors that bind neuropeptides, cytokines, serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine, acetylcholine, or opiates."
DB00981,Physostigmine,CHEMBL94,"Physostigmine inhibits acetylcholinesterase, the enzyme responsible for the breakdown of used acetylcholine. By interfering with the metabolism of acetylcholine, physostigmine indirectly stimulates both nicotinic and muscarinic receptors due to the consequential increase in available acetylcholine at the synapse."
DB00982,Isotretinoin,CHEMBL547,"Isotretinoin noticeably reduces the production of sebum and shrinks the sebaceous glands. It stabilises keratinization and prevents comedones from forming. It also reduces inflammation in moderate-severe inflammatory acne. The exact mechanism of action is unknown, however it is known that it alters DNA transcription."
DB00983,Formoterol,CHEMBL1256786,"The pharmacologic effects of beta2-adrenoceptor agonist drugs, including formoterol, are at least in part attributable to stimulation of intracellular adenyl cyclase, the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to cyclic-3', 5'-adenosine monophosphate (cyclic AMP). Increased cyclic AMP levels cause relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle and inhibits the release of pro-inflammatory mast-cell mediators such as histamine and leukotrienes. Formoterol also inhibits histamine-induced plasma albumin extravasation in anesthetized guinea pigs and inhibits allergen-induced eosinophil influx in dogs with airway hyper-responsiveness. The relevance of these in vitro and animal findings to humans is unknown."
DB00984,Nandrolone phenpropionate,CHEMBL1200412,"Nandrolone is an androgen receptor agonist. The drug bound to the receptor complexes which allows it to enter the nucleus and bind directly to specific nucleotide sequences of the chromosomal DNA. The areas of binding are called hormone response elements (HREs), and influence transcriptional activity of certain genes, producing the androgen effects."
DB00985,Dimenhydrinate,CHEMBL1200406,"The mechanism by which some antihistamines exert their antiemetic, anti&ndash;motion sickness, and antivertigo effects is not precisely known but may be related to their central anticholinergic actions. They diminish vestibular stimulation and depress labyrinthine function. An action on the medullary chemoreceptive trigger zone may also be involved in the antiemetic effect. Dimenhydrinate is a competitive antagonist at the histamine H1 receptor, which is widely distributed in the human brain. Dimenhydrinate's anti-emetic effect is probably due to H1 antagonism in the vestibular system in the brain. "
DB00986,Glycopyrronium,CHEMBL1201027,"Glycopyrrolate binds competitively to the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor. Like other anticholinergic (antimuscarinic) agents, it inhibits the action of acetylcholine on structures innervated by postganglionic cholinergic nerves and on smooth muscles that respond to acetylcholine but lack cholinergic innervation. These peripheral cholinergic receptors are present in the autonomic effector cells of smooth muscle, cardiac muscle, the sinoatrial node, the atrioventricular node, exocrine glands and, to a limited degree, in the autonomic ganglia. Thus, it diminishes the volume and free acidity of gastric secretions and controls excessive pharyngeal, tracheal, and bronchial secretions."
DB00987,Cytarabine,CHEMBL803,"Cytarabine acts through direct DNA damage and incorporation into DNA. Cytarabine is cytotoxic to a wide variety of proliferating mammalian cells in culture. It exhibits cell phase specificity, primarily killing cells undergoing DNA synthesis (S-phase) and under certain conditions blocking the progression of cells from the G1 phase to the S-phase. Although the mechanism of action is not completely understood, it appears that cytarabine acts through the inhibition of DNA polymerase. A limited, but significant, incorporation of cytarabine into both DNA and RNA has also been reported."
DB00988,Dopamine,CHEMBL59,"Dopamine is a precursor to norepinephrine in noradrenergic nerves and is also a neurotransmitter in certain areas of the central nervous system. Dopamine produces positive chronotropic and inotropic effects on the myocardium, resulting in increased heart rate and cardiac contractility. This is accomplished directly by exerting an agonist action on beta-adrenoceptors and indirectly by causing release of norepinephrine from storage sites in sympathetic nerve endings. In the brain, dopamine actas as an agonist to the five dopamine receptor subtypes (D!, D2, D3, D4, D5)."
DB00989,Rivastigmine,CHEMBL636,"Rivastigmine is a carbamate derivative that is structurally related to physostigmine, but not to donepezil and tacrine. The precise mechanism of rivastigmine has not been fully determined, but it is suggested that rivastigmine binds reversibly with and inactivates chlolinesterase (eg. acetylcholinesterase, butyrylcholinesterase), preventing the hydrolysis of acetycholine, and thus leading to an increased concentration of acetylcholine at cholinergic synapses. The anticholinesterase activity of rivastigmine is relatively specific for brain acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase compared with those in peripheral tissues."
DB00990,Exemestane,CHEMBL1200374,"Breast cancer cell growth may be estrogen-dependent. Aromatase (exemestane) is the principal enzyme that converts androgens to estrogens both in pre- and postmenopausal women. While the main source of estrogen (primarily estradiol) is the ovary in premenopausal women, the principal source of circulating estrogens in postmenopausal women is from conversion of adrenal and ovarian androgens (androstenedione and testosterone) to estrogens (estrone and estradiol) by the aromatase enzyme in peripheral tissues. Estrogen deprivation through aromatase inhibition is an effective and selective treatment for some postmenopausal patients with hormone-dependent breast cancer. Exemestane is an irreversible, steroidal aromatase inactivator, structurally related to the natural substrate androstenedione. It acts as a false substrate for the aromatase enzyme, and is processed to an intermediate that binds irreversibly to the active site of the enzyme causing its inactivation, an effect also known as ""suicide inhibition"". Exemestane significantly lowers circulating estrogen concentrations in postmenopausal women, but has no detectable effect on the adrenal biosynthesis of corticosteroids or aldosterone. This reduction in serum and tumor concentrations of estrogen delays tumor growth and disease progression. Exemestane has no effect on other enzymes involved in the steroidogenic pathway up to a concentration at least 600 times higher than that inhibiting the aromatase enzyme."
DB00991,Oxaprozin,CHEMBL1071,"Anti-inflammatory effects of Oxaprozin are believed to be due to inhibition of cylooxygenase in platelets which leads to the blockage of prostaglandin synthesis. Antipyretic effects may be due to action on the hypothalamus, resulting in an increased peripheral blood flow, vasodilation, and subsequent heat dissipation. Oxaprozin is a non-selective NSAID, with a cell assay system showing lower COX-2 selectivity implying higher COX-1 selectivity.   "
DB00992,Methyl aminolevulinate,CHEMBL1096562,"Photosensitization following application of methyl aminolevulinate cream occurs through the metabolic conversion of methyl aminolevulinate (prodrug) to photoactive porphyrins (PAP), which accumulates in the skin lesions to which the cream has been applied. When exposed to light of appropriate wavelength and energy, the accumulated photoactive porphyrins produce a photodynamic reaction, resulting in a cytotoxic process dependent upon the simultaneous presence of oxygen. The absorption of light results in an excited state of porphyrin molecules, and subsequent spin transfer from photoactive porphyrins to molecular oxygen generates singlet oxygen, which can further react to form superoxide and hydroxyl radicals."
DB00993,Azathioprine,CHEMBL1542,"Azathioprine antagonizes purine metabolism and may inhibit synthesis of DNA, RNA, and proteins. It may also interfere with cellular metabolism and inhibit mitosis. Its mechanism of action is likely due to incorporation of thiopurine analogues into the DNA structure, causing chain termination and cytotoxicity."
DB00994,Neomycin,CHEMBL449118,"Aminoglycosides like neomycin ""irreversibly"" bind to specific 30S-subunit proteins and 16S rRNA. Specifically neomycin binds to four nucleotides of 16S rRNA and a single amino acid of protein S12. This interferes with decoding site in the vicinity of nucleotide 1400 in 16S rRNA of 30S subunit. This region interacts with the wobble base in the anticodon of tRNA. This leads to interference with the initiation complex, misreading of mRNA so incorrect amino acids are inserted into the polypeptide leading to nonfunctional or toxic peptides and the breakup of polysomes into nonfunctional monosomes."
DB00995,Auranofin,CHEMBL1366,"Exactly how auranofin works is not well understood. It may act as an inhibitor of kappab kinase and thioredoxin reductase which would lead to a decreased immune response and decreased free radical production, respectively. In patients with inflammatory arthritis, such as adult and juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, gold salts can decrease the inflammation of the joint lining. This effect can prevent destruction of bone and cartilage."
DB00996,Gabapentin,CHEMBL940,"Gabapentin interacts with cortical neurons at auxillary subunits of voltage-sensitive calcium channels. Gabapentin increases the synaptic concentration of GABA, enhances GABA responses at non-synaptic sites in neuronal tissues, and reduces the release of mono-amine neurotransmitters. One of the mechanisms implicated in this effect of gabapentin is the reduction of the axon excitability measured as an amplitude change of the presynaptic fibre volley (FV) in the CA1 area of the hippocampus. This is mediated through its binding to presynaptic NMDA receptors. Other studies have shown that the antihyperalgesic and antiallodynic effects of gabapentin are mediated by the descending noradrenergic system, resulting in the activation of spinal alpha2-adrenergic receptors. Gabapentin has also been shown to bind and activate the adenosine A1 receptor."
DB00997,Doxorubicin,CHEMBL53463,"Doxorubicin has antimitotic and cytotoxic activity through a number of proposed mechanisms of action: Doxorubicin forms complexes with DNA by intercalation between base pairs, and it inhibits topoisomerase II activity by stabilizing the DNA-topoisomerase II complex, preventing the religation portion of the ligation-religation reaction that topoisomerase II catalyzes."
DB00998,Frovatriptan,CHEMBL1279,"Three distinct pharmacological actions have been implicated in the antimigraine effect of the triptans: (1) stimulation of presynaptic 5-HT<sub>1D</sub> receptors, which serves to inhibit both dural vasodilation and inflammation; (2) direct inhibition of trigeminal nuclei cell excitability via 5-HT<sub>1B/1D</sub> receptor agonism in the brainstem and (3) vasoconstriction of meningeal, dural, cerebral or pial vessels as a result of vascular 5-HT<sub>1B</sub> receptor agonism."
DB00999,Hydrochlorothiazide,CHEMBL435,"Hydrochlorothiazide, a thiazide diuretic, inhibits water reabsorption in the nephron by inhibiting the sodium-chloride symporter (SLC12A3) in the distal convoluted tubule, which is responsible for 5% of total sodium reabsorption. Normally, the sodium-chloride symporter transports sodium and chloride from the lumen into the epithelial cell lining the distal convoluted tubule. The energy for this is provided by a sodium gradient established by sodium-potassium ATPases on the basolateral membrane. Once sodium has entered the cell, it is transported out into the basolateral interstitium via the sodium-potassium ATPase, causing an increase in the osmolarity of the interstitium, thereby establishing an osmotic gradient for water reabsorption. By blocking the sodium-chloride symporter, hydrochlorothiazide effectively reduces the osmotic gradient and water reabsorption throughout the nephron."
DB01000,Cyclacillin,CHEMBL1200356,"The bactericidal activity of cyclacillin results from the inhibition of cell wall synthesis via affinity for penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs). Cyclacillin is stable in the presence of a variety of b-lactamases, including penicillinases and some cephalosporinases."
DB01001,Salbutamol,CHEMBL714,"Salbutamol is a beta(2)-adrenergic agonist and thus it stimulates beta(2)-adrenergic receptors. Binding of albuterol to beta(2)-receptors in the lungs results in relaxation of bronchial smooth muscles. It is believed that salbutamol increases cAMP production by activating adenylate cyclase, and the actions of salbutamol are mediated by cAMP. Increased intracellular cyclic AMP increases the activity of cAMP-dependent protein kinase A, which inhibits the phosphorylation of myosin and lowers intracellular calcium concentrations. A lowered intracellular calcium concentration leads to a smooth muscle relaxation and bronchodilation. In addition to bronchodilation, salbutamol inhibits the release of bronchoconstricting agents from mast cells, inhibits microvascular leakage, and enhances mucociliary clearance.   "
DB01002,Levobupivacaine,CHEMBL1201193,"Local anesthetics such as Levobupivacaine block the generation and the conduction of nerve impulses, presumably by increasing the threshold for electrical excitation in the nerve, by slowing the propagation of the nerve impulse, and by reducing the rate of rise of the action potential. In general, the progression of anesthesia is related to the diameter, myelination and conduction velocity of affected nerve fibers. Specifically, the drug binds to the intracellular portion of sodium channels and blocks sodium influx into nerve cells, which prevents depolarization."
DB01003,Cromoglicic acid,CHEMBL428880,"Cromoglicate inhibits degranulation of mast cells, subsequently preventing the release of histamine and slow-reacting substance of anaphylaxis (SRS-A), mediators of type I allergic reactions. Cromoglicate also may reduce the release of inflammatory leukotrienes. Cromoglicate may act by inhibiting calcium influx."
DB01004,Ganciclovir,CHEMBL182,"Ganciclovir's antiviral activity inhibits virus replication. This inhibitory action is highly selective as the drug must be converted to the active form by a virus-encoded cellular enzyme, thymidine kinase (TK). TK catalyzes phosphorylation of ganciclovir to the monophosphate, which is then subsequently converted into the diphosphate by cellular guanylate kinase and into the triphosphate by a number of cellular enzymes. <i>In vitro</i>, ganciclovir triphosphate stops replication of herpes viral DNA. When used as a substrate for viral DNA polymerase, ganciclovir triphosphate competitively inhibits dATP leading to the formation of 'faulty' DNA. This is where ganciclovir triphosphate is incorporated into the DNA strand replacing many of the adenosine bases. This results in the prevention of DNA synthesis, as phosphodiester bridges can longer to be built, destabilizing the strand. Ganciclovir inhibits viral DNA polymerases more effectively than it does cellular polymerase, and chain elongation resumes when ganciclovir is removed."
DB01005,Hydroxyurea,CHEMBL467,"Hydroxyurea is converted to a free radical nitroxide (NO) in vivo, and transported by diffusion into cells where it quenches the tyrosyl free radical at the active site of the M2 protein subunit of ribonucleotide reductase, inactivating the enzyme. The entire replicase complex, including ribonucleotide reductase, is inactivated and DNA synthesis is selectively inhibited, producing cell death in S phase and synchronization of the fraction of cells that survive. Repair of DNA damaged by chemicals or irradiation is also inhibited by hydroxyurea, offering potential synergy between hydroxyurea and radiation or alkylating agents. Hydroxyurea also increases the level of fetal hemoglobin, leading to a reduction in the incidence of vasoocclusive crises in sickle cell anemia. Levels of fetal hemoglobin increase in response to activation of soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) by hydroxyurea-derived NO."
DB01006,Letrozole,CHEMBL1444,"Letrozole is a nonsteroidal competitive inhibitor of the aromatase enzyme system; it inhibits the conversion of androgens to estrogens. In adult nontumor- and tumorbearing female animals, letrozole is as effective as ovariectomy in reducing uterine weight, elevating serum Leuteinizing hormone (LH), and causing the regression of estrogen-dependent tumors. In contrast to ovariectomy, treatment with letrozole does not lead to an increase in serum (folicile stimulating hormone (FSH). Letrozole selectively inhibits gonadal steroidogenesis but has no significant effect on adrenal mineralocorticoid or glucocorticoid synthesis."
DB01007,Tioconazole,CHEMBL1200438,"Tioconazole interacts with 14-&alpha; demethylase, a cytochrome P-450 enzyme that converts lanosterol to ergosterol, an essential component of the yeast membrane. In this way, tioconazole inhibits ergosterol synthesis, resulting in increased cellular permeability. Tioconazole may also inhibit endogenous respiration, interact with membrane phospholipids, inhibit the transformation of yeasts to mycelial forms and the uptake of purine, impair triglyceride and/or phospholipid biosynthesis, and inhibit the movement of calcium and potassium ions across the cell membrane by blocking the ion transport pathway known as the Gardos channel."
DB01008,Busulfan,CHEMBL820,"Busulfan is an alkylating agent that contains 2 labile methanesulfonate groups attached to opposite ends of a 4-carbon alkyl chain. Once busulfan is hydrolyzed, the methanesulfonate groups are released and carbonium ions are produced. These carbonium ions alkylate DNA, which results in the interference of DNA replication and RNA transcription, ultimately leading to the disruption of nucleic acid function. Specifically, its mechanism of action through alkylation produces guanine-adenine intrastrand crosslinks. This occurs through an SN2 reaction in which the relatively nucleophilic guanine N7 attacks the carbon adjacent to the mesylate leaving group. This kind of damage cannot be repaired by cellular machinery and thus the cell undergoes apoptosis."
DB01009,Ketoprofen,CHEMBL571,"The anti-inflammatory effects of ketoprofen are believed to be due to inhibition cylooxygenase-2 (COX-2), an enzyme involved in prostaglandin synthesis via the arachidonic acid pathway. This results in decreased levels of prostaglandins that mediate pain, fever and inflammation. Ketoprofen is a non-specific cyclooxygenase inhibitor and inhibition of COX-1 is thought to confer some of its side effects, such as GI upset and ulceration. Ketoprofen is thought to have anti-bradykinin activity, as well as lysosomal membrane-stabilizing action. Antipyretic effects may be due to action on the hypothalamus, resulting in an increased peripheral blood flow, vasodilation, and subsequent heat dissipation. "
DB01010,Edrophonium,CHEMBL1104,"Edrophonium works by prolonging the action acetylcholine, which is found naturally in the body. It does this by inhibiting the action of the enzyme acetylcholinesterase. Acetylcholine stimulates nicotinic and muscarinic receptors. When stimulated, these receptors have a range of effects."
DB01011,Metyrapone,CHEMBL934,"The pharmacological effect of Metopirone is to reduce cortisol and corticosterone production by inhibiting the 11-&szlig;-hydroxylation reaction in the adrenal cortex. Removal of the strong inhibitory feedback mechanism exerted by cortisol results in an increase in adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) production by the pituitary. With continued blockade of the enzymatic steps leading to production of cortisol and corticosterone, there is a marked increase in adrenocortical secretion of their immediate precursors, 11-desoxycortisol and desoxycorticosterone, which are weak suppressors of ACTH release, and a corresponding elevation of these steroids in the plasma and of their metabolites in the urine. These metabolites are readily determined by measuring urinary 17-hydroxycorticosteroids (17-OHCS) or 17-ketogenic steroids (17-KGS). Because of these actions, metopirone is used as a diagnostic test, with urinary 17-OHCS measured as an index of pituitary ACTH responsiveness. Metopirone may also suppress biosynthesis of aldosterone, resulting in a mild natriuresis."
DB01012,Cinacalcet,CHEMBL1201284,"The calcium-sensing receptors on the surface of the chief cell of the parathyroid gland is the principal regulator of parathyroid hormone secretion (PTH). Cinacalcet directly lowers parathyroid hormone levels by increasing the sensitivity of the calcium sensing receptors to activation by extracellular calcium, resulting in the inhibition of PTH secretion. The reduction in PTH is associated with a concomitant decrease in serum calcium levels."
DB01013,Clobetasol propionate,CHEMBL1159650,"The precise mechanism of the antiinflammatory activity of topical steroids in the treatment of steroid-responsive dermatoses, in general, is uncertain. However, corticosteroids are thought to act by the induction of phospholipase A<sub>2</sub> inhibitory proteins, collectively called lipocortins. It is postulated that these proteins control the biosynthesis of potent mediators of inflammation such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes by inhibiting the release of their common precursor arachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid is released from membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A<sub>2</sub>. Initially, however, clobetasol, like other corticosteroids, bind to the glucocorticoid receptor, which complexes, enteres the cell nucleus and modifies genetic transcription (transrepression/transactivation)."
DB01014,Balsalazide,CHEMBL1201346,"The mechanism of action of 5-aminosalicylic acid is unknown, but appears exert its anti-inflammatory effects locally (in the GI tract) rather than systemically. Mucosal production of arachidonic acid metabolites, both through the cyclooxygenase pathways (catalyzes the formation of prostaglandin precursors from arachidonic acid), and through the lipoxygenase pathways (catalyzes the formation of leukotrienes and hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids from arachidonic acid and its metabolites), is increased in patients with chronic inflammatory bowel disease. Therefore, it is possible that 5-aminosalicylic acid diminishes inflammation by blocking production of arachidonic acid metabolites in the colon through both the inhibition of cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase."
DB01015,Sulfamethoxazole,CHEMBL443,"Sulfonamides inhibit the enzymatic conversion of pteridine and p-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) to dihydropteroic acid by competing with PABA for binding to dihydrofolate synthetase, an intermediate of tetrahydrofolic acid (THF) synthesis. THF is required for the synthesis of purines and dTMP and inhibition of its synthesis inhibits bacterial growth. Pyrimethamine and trimethoprim inhibit dihydrofolate reductase, another step in THF synthesis, and therefore act synergistically with the sulfonamides."
DB01016,Glyburide,CHEMBL472,"Sulfonylureas such as glyburide bind to ATP-sensitive potassium channels on the pancreatic cell surface, reducing potassium conductance and causing depolarization of the membrane. Depolarization stimulates calcium ion influx through voltage-sensitive calcium channels, raising intracellular concentrations of calcium ions, which induces the secretion, or exocytosis, of insulin."
DB01017,Minocycline,CHEMBL1434,"Minocycline passes directly through the lipid bilayer or passively diffuses through porin channels in the bacterial membrane. Tetracyclines like minocycline bind to the 30S ribosomal subunit, preventing the binding of tRNA to the mRNA-ribosome complex and interfering with protein synthesis."
DB01018,Guanfacine,CHEMBL862,"Guanfacine selectively stimulates central alpha(2)-adrenergic receptors, resulting in inhibition of sympathetic vasomotor centers, which contributes predominantly to the hypotensive effects of the drug. Central effects of guanfacine lead to reduced peripheral sympathetic nerve impulses from the vasomotor center to the heart and blood vessels. This results in a decrease in peripheral vascular resistance and a reduction in heart rate. The stimulation of peripheral alpha(2)-adrenergic receptors may also contribute to hypotensive effects. "
DB01019,Bethanechol,CHEMBL1482,"Bethanechol directly stimulates cholinergic receptors in the parasympathetic nervous system while stimulating the ganglia to a lesser extent. Its effects are predominantly muscarinic, inducing little effect on nicotinic receptors and negligible effects on the cardiovascular system."
DB01020,Isosorbide Mononitrate,CHEMBL1311,"Similar to other nitrites and organic nitrates, Isosorbide Mononitrate is converted to nitric oxide (NO), an active intermediate compound which activates the enzyme guanylate cyclase (Atrial natriuretic peptide receptor A). This stimulates the synthesis of cyclic guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cGMP) which then activates a series of protein kinase-dependent phosphorylations in the smooth muscle cells, eventually resulting in the dephosphorylation of the myosin light chain of the smooth muscle fiber. The subsequent release of calcium ions results in the relaxation of the smooth muscle cells and vasodilation."
DB01021,Trichlormethiazide,CHEMBL1054,"Trichlormethiazide appears to block the active reabsorption of chloride and possibly sodium in the ascending loop of Henle, altering electrolyte transfer in the proximal tubule. This results in excretion of sodium, chloride, and water and, hence, diuresis. As a diuretic, Trichloromethiazide inhibits active chloride reabsorption at the early distal tubule via the Na-Cl cotransporter, resulting in an increase in the excretion of sodium, chloride, and water. Thiazides like Trichloromethiazide also inhibit sodium ion transport across the renal tubular epithelium through binding to the thiazide sensitive sodium-chloride transporter. This results in an increase in potassium excretion via the sodium-potassium exchange mechanism. The antihypertensive mechanism of Trichloromethiazide is less well understood although it may be mediated through its action on carbonic anhydrases in the smooth muscle or through its action on the large-conductance calcium-activated potassium (KCa) channel, also found in the smooth muscle."
DB01022,Phylloquinone,CHEMBL1550,"Vitamin K is an essential cofactor for the gamma-carboxylase enzymes which catalyze the posttranslational gamma-carboxylation of glutamic acid residues in inactive hepatic precursors of coagulation factors II (prothrombin), VII, IX and X. Gamma-carboxylation converts these inactive precursors into active coagulation factors which are secreted by hepatocytes into the blood. Supplementing with Phylloquinone results in a relief of vitamin K deficiency symptoms which include easy bruisability, epistaxis, gastrointestinal bleeding, menorrhagia and hematuria."
DB01023,Felodipine,CHEMBL1480,"Felodipine decreases arterial smooth muscle contractility and subsequent vasoconstriction by inhibiting the influx of calcium ions through voltage-gated L-type calcium channels. It reversibly competes against nitrendipine and other DHP CCBs for DHP binding sites in vascular smooth muscle and cultured rabbit atrial cells. Calcium ions entering the cell through these channels bind to calmodulin. Calcium-bound calmodulin then binds to and activates myosin light chain kinase (MLCK). Activated MLCK catalyzes the phosphorylation of the regulatory light chain subunit of myosin, a key step in muscle contraction. Signal amplification is achieved by calcium-induced calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum through ryanodine receptors. Inhibition of the initial influx of calcium decreases the contractile activity of arterial smooth muscle cells and results in vasodilation. The vasodilatory effects of felodipine result in an overall decrease in blood pressure. Felodipine may be used to treat mild to moderate essential hypertension."
DB01024,Mycophenolic acid,CHEMBL866,"Mycophenolic acid is a potent, selective, uncompetitive, and reversible inhibitor of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH), and therefore inhibits the de novo pathway of guanosine nucleotide synthesis without incorporation into DNA. Because T- and B-lymphocytes are critically dependent for their proliferation on de novo synthesis of purines, whereas other cell types can utilize salvage pathways, mycophenolic acid has potent cytostatic effects on lymphocytes. Mycophenolic acid inhibits proliferative responses of T- and B-lymphocytes to both mitogenic and allospecific stimulation. Addition of guanosine or deoxyguanosine reverses the cytostatic effects of mycophenolic acid on lymphocytes. Mycophenolic acid also suppresses antibody formation by B-lymphocytes. Mycophenolic acid prevents the glycosylation of lymphocyte and monocyte glycoproteins that are involved in intercellular adhesion to endothelial cells and may inhibit recruitment of leukocytes into sites of inflammation and graft rejection."
DB01025,Amlexanox,CHEMBL1096,"As a benzopyrano-bipyridine carboxylic acid derivative, amlexanox has anti-inflammatory and antiallergic properties. It inhibits chemical mediatory release of the slow-reacting substance of anaphylaxis (SRS-A) and may have antagonistic effects on interleukin-3. When cells are under stress, they release an inactive form of human fibroblast growth factor 1 (FGF-1), a potent mitogen (entity that causes mitosis). Amlexanox binds to FGF1, increasing its conformational stability, sterically blocking Cu(2+) induced oxidation which normally leads to activation of FGF-1.  "
DB01026,Ketoconazole,CHEMBL157101,"Ketoconazole interacts with 14-&alpha; demethylase, a cytochrome P-450 enzyme necessary for the conversion of lanosterol to ergosterol. This results in inhibition of ergosterol synthesis and increased fungal cellular permeability. Other mechanisms may involve the inhibition of endogenous respiration, interaction with membrane phospholipids, inhibition of yeast transformation to mycelial forms, inhibition of purine uptake, and impairment of triglyceride and/or phospholipid biosynthesis. Ketoconazole can also inhibit the synthesis of thromboxane and sterols such as aldosterone, cortisol, and testosterone."
DB01028,Methoxyflurane,CHEMBL1341,"Methoxyflurane induces a reduction in junctional conductance by decreasing gap junction channel opening times and increasing gap junction channel closing times. Methoxyflurane also activates calcium dependent ATPase in the sarcoplasmic reticulum by increasing the fluidity of the lipid membrane. It also appears to bind the D subunit of ATP synthase and NADH dehydogenase. Methoxyflurane also binds to the GABA receptor, the large conductance Ca<sup>2+</sup> activated potassium channel, the glutamate receptor and the glycine receptor."
DB01029,Irbesartan,CHEMBL1513,"Irbesartan is a nonpeptide tetrazole derivative and an angiotensin II antagonist that selectively blocks the binding of angiotensin II to the AT<sub>1</sub> receptor. In the renin-angiotensin system, angiotensin I is converted by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) to form angiotensin II. Angiotensin II stimulates the adrenal cortex to synthesize and secrete aldosterone, which decreases the excretion of sodium and increases the excretion of potassium. Angiotensin II also acts as a vasoconstrictor in vascular smooth muscle. Irbesartan, by blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT<sub>1</sub> receptor, promotes vasodilation and decreases the effects of aldosterone. The negative feedback regulation of angiotensin II on renin secretion is also inhibited, but the resulting rise in plasma renin concentrations and consequent rise in angiotensin II plasma concentrations do not counteract the blood pressure&ndash;lowering effect that occurs. The action of ARBs is different from ACE inhibitors, which block the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, meaning that the production of angiotensin II is not completely inhibited, as the hormone can be formed via other enzymes. Also, unlike ACE inhibitors, irbesartan and other ARBs do not interfere with response to bradykinins and substance P, which allows for the absence of adverse effects that are present in ACE inhibitors (eg. dry cough)."
DB01030,Topotecan,CHEMBL84,"Topotecan has the same mechanism of action as irinotecan and is believed to exert its cytotoxic effects during the S-phase of DNA synthesis. Topoisomerase I relieves torsional strain in DNA by inducing reversible single strand breaks. Topotecan binds to the topoisomerase I-DNA complex and prevents religation of these single strand breaks. This ternary complex interferes with the moving replication fork, which leads to the induction of replication arrest and lethal double-stranded breaks in DNA. As mammalian cells cannot efficiently repair these double strand breaks, the formation of this ternary complex eventually leads to apoptosis (programmed cell death).

Topotecan mimics a DNA base pair and binds at the site of DNA cleavage by intercalating between the upstream (−1) and downstream (+1) base pairs. Intercalation displaces the downstream DNA, thus preventing religation of the cleaved strand. By specifically binding to the enzyme–substrate complex, Topotecan acts as an uncompetitive inhibitor."
DB01031,Ethinamate,CHEMBL1576,"The mechanism of action is not known. However, studies have shown that ethinamate inhibits carbonic anhydrases I and II (J Biol Chem. 1992 Dec 15;267(35):25044-50). This inhibition by ethinamate is not sufficiently strong, however, to implicate carbonic anhydrases I and II in the mechanism of action."
DB01032,Probenecid,CHEMBL897,"Probenecid inhibits the tubular reabsorption of urate, thus increasing the urinary excretion of uric acid and decreasing serum urate levels. Probenecid may also reduce plasma binding of urate and inhibit renal secretion of uric acid at subtherapeutic concentrations. The mechanism by which probenecid inhibits renal tubular transport is not known, but the drug may inhibit transport enzymes that require a source of high energy phosphate bonds and/or nonspecifically interfere with substrate access to protein receptor sites on the kidney tubules."
DB01033,Mercaptopurine,CHEMBL1425,"Mercaptopurine competes with hypoxanthine and guanine for the enzyme hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRTase) and is itself converted to thioinosinic acid (TIMP). This intracellular nucleotide inhibits several reactions involving inosinic acid (IMP), including the conversion of IMP to xanthylic acid (XMP) and the conversion of IMP to adenylic acid (AMP) via adenylosuccinate (SAMP). In addition, 6-methylthioinosinate (MTIMP) is formed by the methylation of TIMP. Both TIMP and MTIMP have been reported to inhibit glutamine-5-phosphoribosylpyrophosphate amidotransferase, the first enzyme unique to the de novo pathway for purine ribonucleotide synthesis. Experiments indicate that radiolabeled mercaptopurine may be recovered from the DNA in the form of deoxythioguanosine. Some mercaptopurine is converted to nucleotide derivatives of 6-thioguanine (6-TG) by the sequential actions of inosinate (IMP) dehydrogenase and xanthylate (XMP) aminase, converting TIMP to thioguanylic acid (TGMP)."
DB01034,Cerulenin,CHEMBL45627,"Irreversibly binds to fatty acid synthase, specifically b-ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein synthase (FabH, FabB and FabF condensation enzymes). A number of tumor cells and cell lines have been observed to have highly upregulated expression and activity of fatty acid synthase (FAS). Inhibition of FAS by cerulenin leads to cytotoxicity and apoptosis in human cancer cell lines, an effect believed to be mediated by the accumulation of malonyl-coenzyme A in cells with an upregulated FAS pathway."
DB01035,Procainamide,CHEMBL640,Procainamide is sodium channel blocker. It stabilizes the neuronal membrane by inhibiting the ionic fluxes required for the initiation and conduction of impulses thereby effecting local anesthetic action.
DB01036,Tolterodine,CHEMBL1382,"Both tolterodine and its active metabolite, 5-hydroxymethyltolterodine, act as competitive antagonists at muscarinic receptors. This antagonism results in inhibition of bladder contraction, decrease in detrusor pressure, and an incomplete emptying of the bladder."
DB01037,Selegiline,CHEMBL972,"Although the mechanisms for selegiline's beneficial action in the treatment of Parkinson's disease are not fully understood, the selective, irreversible inhibition of monoamine oxidase type B (MAO-B) is thought to be of primary importance. MAO-B is involved in the oxidative deamination of dopamine in the brain. Selegiline binds to MAO-B within the nigrostriatal pathways in the central nervous system, thus blocking microsomal metabolism of dopamine and enhancing the dopaminergic activity in the substantial nigra. Selegiline may also increase dopaminergic activity through mechanisms other than inhibition of MAO-B. At higher doses, selegiline can also inhibit monozmine oxidase type A (MAO-A), allowing it to be used for the treatment of depression."
DB01038,Carphenazine,CHEMBL1201328,"A yellow, powdered, phenothiazine antipsychotic agent used in the treatment of acute or chronic schizophrenia. The term ""phenothiazines"" is used to describe the largest of the five main classes of neuroleptic antipsychotic drugs. These drugs have antipsychotic and, often, antiemetic properties, although they may also cause severe side effects such as akathisia, tardive dyskinesia and extrapyramidal symptoms. Carphenazine blocks postsynaptic mesolimbic dopaminergic D1 and D2 receptors in the brain; depresses the release of hypothalamic and hypophyseal hormones and is believed to depress the reticular activating system thus affecting basal metabolism, body temperature, wakefulness, vasomotor tone, and emesis."
DB01039,Fenofibrate,CHEMBL672,"Fenofibrate exerts its therapeutic effects through activation of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor a (PPARa). This increases lipolysis and elimination of triglyceride-rich particles from plasma by activating lipoprotein lipase and reducing production of apoprotein C-III. The resulting fall in triglycerides produces an alteration in the size and composition of LDL from small, dense particles, to large buoyant particles. These larger particles have a greater affinity for cholesterol receptors and are catabolized rapidly."
DB01040,Hydroxystilbamidine Isethionate,CHEMBL1200847,Hydroxystilbamidine isethionate (HSB) acts on extracellular DNA and lysosomes. In Trypanosomes there is extensive and selective binding of HSB to the kinetoplastic DNA. This inhibits cell division and reproduction. In yeast there is evidence of binding to extranuclear DNA causing numerous mutations. HSB is also taken up in the lysosomes and leads to a significant increase in the number of lysosome-like bodies and secretion granules in trypanosomal organisms. HSB may also stabilize lysosomal membranes. HSB has also been found to bind RNA and is a powerful inhibitor of cellular ribonucleases.
DB01041,Thalidomide,CHEMBL468,"In patients with erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) the mechanism of action is not fully understood. Available data from in vitro studies and preliminary clinical trials suggest that the immunologic effects of this compound can vary substantially under different conditions, but may be related to suppression of excessive tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a) production and down-modulation of selected cell surface adhesion molecules involved in leukocyte migration. For example, administration of thalidomide has been reported to decrease circulating levels of TNF-a in patients with ENL, however, it has also been shown to increase plasma TNF-a levels in HIV-seropositive patients. As a cancer treatment, the drug may act as a VEGF inhibitor."
DB01042,Melphalan,CHEMBL852,"Alkylating agents work by three different mechanisms: 1) attachment of alkyl groups to DNA bases (primarily at the N-7 position of guanine and to a lesser extent, at the N-3 position of adenine), forming monoadducts and resulting in the DNA being fragmented by repair enzymes in their attempts to replace the alkylated bases, preventing DNA synthesis and RNA transcription from the affected DNA, 2) DNA damage via the formation of cross-links (bonds between atoms in the DNA) which prevents DNA from being separated for synthesis or transcription, and 3) the induction of mispairing of the nucleotides leading to mutations."
DB01043,Memantine,CHEMBL807,"Memantine exerts its action through uncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonism, binding preferentially to the NMDA receptor-operated cation channels. Prolonged increased levels of glutamate in the brain of demented patients are sufficient to counter the voltage-dependent block of NMDA receptors by Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions and allow continuous influx of Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions into cells, ultimately resulting in neuronal degeneration. Studies suggest that memantine binds more effectively than Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions at the NMDA receptor, and thereby effectively blocks this prolonged influx of Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions through the NMDA channel whilst preserving the transient physiological activation of the channels by higher concentrations of synaptically released glutamate. Thus memantine protects against chronically elevated concentrations of glutamate. Memantine also has antagonistic activity at the type 3 serotonergic (5-HT<sub>3</sub>) receptor with a potency that is similar to that at the NMDA receptor, and lower antagonistic activity at the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. This drug has no affinity for γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), benzodiazepine, dopamine, adrenergic, histamine, or glycine receptors or for voltage-dependent calcium, sodium, or potassium channels."
DB01044,Gatifloxacin,CHEMBL31,"The bactericidal action of Gatifloxacin results from inhibition of the enzymes topoisomerase II (DNA gyrase) and topoisomerase IV, which are required for bacterial DNA replication, transcription, repair, and recombination."
DB01045,Rifampicin,CHEMBL374478,"Rifampin acts via the inhibition of DNA-dependent RNA polymerase, leading to a suppression of RNA synthesis and cell death."
DB01046,Lubiprostone,CHEMBL1201134,"Lubiprostone acts by specifically activating ClC-2 chloride channels, which is a normal constituent of the apical membrane of the human intestine, in a protein kinase A action independent fashion. Activation of ClC-2 chloride channels causes an efflux of chloride ions into the lumen, which in turn leads to an efflux of sodium ions through a paracellular pathway to maintain isoelectric neutrality. As a result, water follows sodium into the lumen in order to maintain isotonic equilibrium, thereby increasing intestinal fluid secretion. By increasing intestinal fluid secretion, lubiprostone increases motility in the intestine, thereby increasing the passage of stool and alleviating symptoms associated with chronic idiopathic constipation. Activation of ClC-2 chloride channels may also stimulate the recovery of muscosal barrier function by restoring tight junction protein complexes in the intestine. Patch clamp cell studies in human cell lines have indicated that the majority of the beneficial biological activity of lubiprostone and its metabolites is observed only on the apical (luminal) portion of the gastrointestinal epithelium."
DB01047,Fluocinonide,CHEMBL1501,"Fluocinonide is a potent glucocorticoid steroid used topically as anti-inflammatory agent for the treatment of skin disorders such as eczema. It relieves itching, redness, dryness, crusting, scaling, inflammation, and discomfort. Fluocinonide binds to the cytosolic glucocorticoid receptor. After binding the receptor the newly formed receptor-ligand complex translocates itself into the cell nucleus, where it binds to many glucocorticoid response elements (GRE) in the promoter region of the target genes. The DNA bound receptor then interacts with basic transcription factors, causing the increase in expression of specific target genes. The anti-inflammatory actions of corticosteroids are thought to involve lipocortins, phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins which, through inhibition arachidonic acid, control the biosynthesis of prostaglandins and leukotrienes. Specifically glucocorticoids induce lipocortin-1 (annexin-1) synthesis, which then binds to cell membranes preventing the phospholipase A2 from coming into contact with its substrate arachidonic acid. This leads to diminished eicosanoid production. Cyclooxygenase (both COX-1 and COX-2) expression is also suppressed, potentiating the effect. In another words, the two main products in inflammation Prostaglandins and Leukotrienes are inhibited by the action of Glucocorticoids. Glucocorticoids also stimulate the lipocortin-1 escaping to the extracellular space, where it binds to the leukocyte membrane receptors and inhibits various inflammatory events: epithelial adhesion, emigration, chemotaxis, phagocytosis, respiratory burst and the release of various inflammatory mediators (lysosomal enzymes, cytokines, tissue plasminogen activator, chemokines etc.) from neutrophils, macrophages and mastocytes. Additionally the immune system is suppressed by corticosteroids due to a decrease in the function of the lymphatic system, a reduction in immunoglobulin and complement concentrations, the precipitation of lymphocytopenia, and interference with antigen-antibody binding.  Like other glucocorticoid agents Fluocinolone acetonide acts as a physiological antagonist to insulin by decreasing glycogenesis (formation of glycogen).  It also promotes the breakdown of lipids (lipolysis), and proteins, leading to the mobilization of extrahepatic amino acids and ketone bodies. This leads to increased circulating glucose concentrations (in the blood). There is also decreased glycogen formation in the liver."
DB01048,Abacavir,CHEMBL1380,"Abacavir is a carbocyclic synthetic nucleoside analogue and an antiviral agent. Intracellularly, abacavir is converted by cellular enzymes to the active metabolite carbovir triphosphate, an analogue of deoxyguanosine-5'-triphosphate (dGTP). Carbovir triphosphate inhibits the activity of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) both by competing with the natural substrate dGTP and by its incorporation into viral DNA. Viral DNA growth is terminated because the incorporated nucleotide lacks a 3'-OH group, which is needed to form the 5′ to 3′ phosphodiester linkage essential for DNA chain elongation. "
DB01049,Ergoloid mesylate,,"Ergoloid mesylates act centrally, decreasing vascular tone and slowing the heart rate, and acts peripherally to block alpha-receptors. One other possible mechanism is the effect of ergoloid mesylates on neuronal cell metabolism, resulting in improved oxygen uptake and cerebral metabolism, thereby normalizing depressed neurotransmitter levels."
DB01050,Ibuprofen,CHEMBL521,"The exact mechanism of action of ibuprofen is unknown. Ibuprofen is a non-selective inhibitor of cyclooxygenase, an enzyme invovled in prostaglandin synthesis via the arachidonic acid pathway. Its pharmacological effects are believed to be due to inhibition cylooxygenase-2 (COX-2) which decreases the synthesis of  prostaglandins involved in mediating inflammation, pain, fever and swelling. Antipyretic effects may be due to action on the hypothalamus, resulting in an increased peripheral blood flow, vasodilation, and subsequent heat dissipation. Inhibition of COX-1 is thought to cause some of the side effects of ibuprofen including GI ulceration. Ibuprofen is administered as a racemic mixture. The R-enantiomer undergoes extensive interconversion to the S-enantiomer  <i>in vivo</i>. The S-enantiomer is believed to be the more pharmacologically active enantiomer."
DB01051,Novobiocin,CHEMBL36506,Novobiocin is an aminocoumarin. Aminocoumarins are very potent inhibitors of bacterial DNA gyrase and work by inhibiting the GyrB subunit of the enzyme involved in energy tranduction. Novobiocin as well as the other aminocoumarin antibiotics act as competitive inhibitors of the ATPase reaction catalysed by GyrB.
DB01053,Benzylpenicillin,CHEMBL29,"By binding to specific penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) located inside the bacterial cell wall, penicillin G inhibits the third and last stage of bacterial cell wall synthesis.

DB01054,Nitrendipine,CHEMBL475534,"By deforming the channel, inhibiting ion-control gating mechanisms, and/or interfering with the release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, Nitrendipine inhibits the influx of extracellular calcium across the myocardial and vascular smooth muscle cell membranes The decrease in intracellular calcium inhibits the contractile processes of the myocardial smooth muscle cells, causing dilation of the coronary and systemic arteries, increased oxygen delivery to the myocardial tissue, decreased total peripheral resistance, decreased systemic blood pressure, and decreased afterload."
DB01055,Mimosine,CHEMBL245416,"Mimosine causes inhibition of DNA replication, changes in the progression of the cells in the cell cycle, and apoptosis. Mimosine appears to introduce breaks into DNA. Mimosine is an iron/zinc chelator. Iron depletion induces DNA double-strand breaks in treated cells, and activates a DNA damage response that results in focal phosphorylation of histones. This leads to inhibition of DNA replication and/or DNA elongation. Some studies indicate that mimosine prevents the initiation of DNA replication, whereas other studies indicate that mimosine disrupts elongation of the replication fork by impairing deoxyribonucleotide synthesis by inhibiting the activity of the iron-dependent enzyme ribonucleotide reductase and the transcription of the cytoplasmic serine hydroxymethyltransferase gene (SHMT). Inhibition of serine hydroxymethyltransferase is moderated by a zinc responsive unit located in front of the SHMT gene."
DB01056,Tocainide,CHEMBL1762,"Tocainide acts on sodium channels on the neuronal cell membrane, limiting the spread of seizure activity and reducing seizure propagation. Tocainide binds preferentially to the inactive state of the sodium channels.The antiarrhythmic actions are mediated through effects on sodium channels in Purkinje fibers."
DB01057,Echothiophate,CHEMBL1201341,"Echothiophate Iodide is a long-acting cholinesterase inhibitor for topical use which enhances the effect of endogenously liberated acetylcholine in iris, ciliary muscle, and other parasympathetically innervated structures of the eye. Echothiophate iodide binds irreversibly to cholinesterase, and is long acting due to the slow rate of hydrolysis by cholinesterase. It causes miosis, increase in facility of outflow of aqueous humor, fall in intraocular pressure, and potentiation of accommodation. "
DB01058,Praziquantel,CHEMBL976,"Praziquantel works by causing severe spasms and paralysis of the worms' muscles. This paralysis is accompanied - and probably caused - by a rapid Ca 2+ influx inside the schistosome. Morphological alterations are another early effect of praziquantel. These morphological alterations are accompanied by an increased exposure of schistosome antigens at the parasite surface. The worms are then either completely destroyed in the intestine or passed in the stool. An interesting quirk of praziquantel is that it is relatively ineffective against juvenile schistosomes. While initially effective, effectiveness against schistosomes decreases until it reaches a minimum at 3-4 weeks. Effectiveness then increases again until it is once again fully effective at 6-7 weeks. Glutathione S-transferase (GST), an essential detoxification enzyme in parasitic helminths, is a major vaccine target and a drug target against schistosomiasis. Schistosome calcium ion channels are currently the only known target of praziquantel. "
DB01059,Norfloxacin,CHEMBL9,"The bactericidal action of Norfloxacin results from inhibition of the enzymes topoisomerase II (DNA gyrase) and topoisomerase IV, which are required for bacterial DNA replication, transcription, repair, and recombination. Norfloxacin is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that is active against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacterias. The fluorine atom at the 6 position increases potency against gram-negative organisms, and the piperazine moiety at the 7 position is responsible for anti-pseudomonal activity"
DB01060,Amoxicillin,CHEMBL1082,"Amoxicillin binds to penicillin-binding protein 1A (PBP-1A) located inside the bacterial cell well. Penicillins acylate the penicillin-sensitive transpeptidase C-terminal domain by opening the lactam ring. This inactivation of the enzyme prevents the formation of a cross-link of two linear peptidoglycan strands, inhibiting the third and last stage of bacterial cell wall synthesis. Cell lysis is then mediated by bacterial cell wall autolytic enzymes such as autolysins; it is possible that amoxicllin interferes with an autolysin inhibitor."

DB01064,Isoprenaline,CHEMBL434,"The pharmacologic effects of isoproterenol are at least in part attributable to stimulation through beta-adrenergic receptors of intracellular adenyl cyclase, the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to cyclic AMP. Increased cyclic AMP levels are associated with relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle and inhibition of release of mediators of immediate hypersensitivity from cells, especially from mast cells."
DB01065,Melatonin,CHEMBL45,"Melatonin is a derivative of tryptophan. It binds to melatonin receptor type 1A, which then acts on adenylate cylcase and the inhibition of a cAMP signal transduction pathway. Melatonin not only inhibits adenylate cyclase, but it also activates phosphilpase C. This potentiates the release of arachidonate. By binding to melatonin receptors 1 and 2, the downstream signallling cascades have various effects in the body. The melatonin receptors are G protein-coupled receptors and are expressed in various tissues of the body. There are two subtypes of the receptor in humans, melatonin receptor 1 (MT1) and melatonin receptor 2 (MT2). Melatonin and melatonin receptor agonists, on market or in clinical trials, all bind to and activate both receptor types.The binding of the agonists to the receptors has been investigated for over two decades or since 1986. It is somewhat known, but still not fully understood. When melatonin receptor agonists bind to and activate their receptors it causes numerous physiological processes.
MT1 receptors are expressed in many regions of the central nervous system (CNS): suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus (SNC), hippocampus, substantia nigra, cerebellum, central dopaminergic pathways, ventral tegmental area and nucleus accumbens. MT1 is also expressed in the retina, ovary, testis, mammary gland, coronary circulation and aorta, gallbladder, liver, kidney, skin and the immune system. MT2 receptors are expressed mainly in the CNS, also in the lung, cardiac, coronary and aortic tissue, myometrium and granulosa cells, immune cells, duodenum and adipocytes.
The binding of melatonin to melatonin receptors activates a few signaling pathways. MT1 receptor activation inhibits the adenylyl cyclase and its inhibition causes a rippling effect of non activation; starting with decreasing formation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), and then progressing to less protein kinase A (PKA) activity, which in turn hinders the phosphorilation of cAMP responsive element-binding protein (CREB binding protein) into P-CREB. MT1 receptors also activate phospholipase C (PLC), affect ion channels and regulate ion flux inside the cell. The binding of melatonin to MT2 receptors inhibits adenylyl cyclase which decreases the formation of cAMP.[4] As well it hinders guanylyl cyclase and therefore the forming of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). Binding to MT2 receptors probably affects PLC which increases protein kinase C (PKC) activity. Activation of the receptor can lead to ion flux inside the cell."
DB01066,Cefditoren,CHEMBL454446,"The bactericidal activity of cefditoren results from the inhibition of cell wall synthesis via affinity for penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs). Cefditoren is stable in the presence of a variety of b-lactamases, including penicillinases and some cephalosporinases."
DB01067,Glipizide,CHEMBL1073,"Sulfonylureas likely bind to ATP-sensitive potassium-channel receptors on the pancreatic cell surface, reducing potassium conductance and causing depolarization of the membrane. Depolarization stimulates calcium ion influx through voltage-sensitive calcium channels, raising intracellular concentrations of calcium ions, which induces the secretion, or exocytosis, of insulin."
DB01068,Clonazepam,CHEMBL452,"Allosteric interactions between central benzodiazepine receptors and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors potentiate the effects of GABA. As GABA is an inhibitory neurotransmitter, this results in increased inhibition of the ascending reticular activating system. Benzodiazepines, in this way, block the cortical and limbic arousal that occurs following stimulation of the reticular pathways."
DB01069,Promethazine,CHEMBL643,"Like other H1-antagonists, promethazine competes with free histamine for binding at H1-receptor sites in the GI tract, uterus, large blood vessels, and bronchial muscle.

DB01070,Dihydrotachysterol,CHEMBL2356023,"Once hydroxylated to 25-hydroxydihydrotachysterol, the modified drug binds to the vitamin D receptor. The bound form of the vitamin D receptor serves as a transcriptional regulator of bone matrix proteins, inducing the expression of osteocalcin and suppressing synthesis of type I collagen. Vitamin D (when bound to the vitamin D receptor)stimulates the expression of a number of proteins involved in transporting calcium from the lumen of the intestine, across the epithelial cells and into blood. This stimulates intestinal calcium absorption and increases renal phosphate excretion. These are functions that are normally carried out by the parathyroid hormone. "
DB01071,Mequitazine,CHEMBL73451,"Mequitazine binds to the histamine H1 receptor sites on effector cells in the gastrointestinal tract, blood vessels, and respiratory tract. This blocks the action of endogenous histamine, which subsequently leads to temporary relief of the negative symptoms brought on by histamine."
DB01072,Atazanavir,CHEMBL1163,"Atazanavir selectively inhibits the virus-specific processing of viral Gag and Gag-Pol polyproteins in HIV-1 infected cells by binding to the active site of HIV-1 protease, thus preventing the formation of mature virions. Atazanavir is not active against HIV-2."
DB01073,Fludarabine,CHEMBL1568,"Fludarabine phosphate is rapidly dephosphorylated to 2-fluoro-ara-A and then phosphorylated intracellularly by deoxycytidine kinase to the active triphosphate, 2-fluoro-ara-ATP. This metabolite appears to act by inhibiting DNA polymerase alpha, ribonucleotide reductase and DNA primase, thus inhibiting DNA synthesis. The mechanism of action of this antimetabolite is not completely characterized and may be multi-faceted."
DB01074,Perhexiline,CHEMBL75880,"Perhexiline binds to the mitochondrial enzyme carnitine palmitoyltransferase (CPT)-1 and CPT-2. It acts by shifting myocardial substrate utilisation from long chain fatty acids to carbohydrates through inhibition of CPT-1 and, to a lesser extent, CPT-2, resulting in increased glucose and lactate utilization. This results in increased ATP production for the same O2 consumption as before and consequently increases myocardial efficiency."
DB01075,Diphenhydramine,CHEMBL657,"Diphenhydramine competes with free histamine for binding at HA-receptor sites. This antagonizes the effects of histamine on HA-receptors, leading to a reduction of the negative symptoms brought on by histamine HA-receptor binding."
DB01076,Atorvastatin,CHEMBL1487,"Atorvastatin selectively and competitively inhibits the hepatic enzyme HMG-CoA reductase. As HMG-CoA reductase is responsible for converting HMG-CoA to mevalonate in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway, this results in a subsequent decrease in hepatic cholesterol levels. Decreased hepatic cholesterol levels stimulates upregulation of hepatic LDL-C receptors which increases hepatic uptake of LDL-C and reduces serum LDL-C concentrations. "
DB01077,Etidronic acid,CHEMBL871,"Bisphosphonates, when attached to bone tissue, are absorbed by osteoclasts, the bone cells that breaks down bone tissue. Although the mechanism of action of non-nitrogenous bisphosphonates has not been fully elucidated, available data suggest that they bind strongly to hydroxyapatite crystals in the bone matrix, preferentially at the sites of increased bone turnover and inhibit the formation and dissolution of the crystals. Other actions may include direct inhibition of mature osteoclast function, promotion of osteoclast apoptosis, and interference with osteoblast-mediated osteoclast activation. Etidronic acid does not interfere with bone mineralization. In malignancy-related hypercalcemia, etidronic acid decreases serum calcium by inhibiting tumour-induced bone resorption and reducing calcium flow from the resorbing bone into the blood. Etidronic acid also reduces morbidity of osteolytic bone metastases by inhibiting tumour-induced bone resorption. Etidronic acid may promote osteoclast apoptosis by competing with adenosine triphosphate (ATP) in the cellular energy metabolism. The osteoclast initiates apoptosis and dies, leading to an overall decrease in the breakdown of bone."
DB01078,Deslanoside,CHEMBL1614,"Deslanoside inhibits the Na-K-ATPase membrane pump, resulting in an increase in intracellular sodium and calcium concentrations. Increased intracellular concentrations of calcium may promote activation of contractile proteins (e.g., actin, myosin). Deslanoside also acts on the electrical activity of the heart, increasing the slope of phase 4 depolarization, shortening the action potential duration, and decreasing the maximal diastolic potential."
DB01079,Tegaserod,CHEMBL76370,"Tegaserod is a 5-HT<sub>4</sub> receptor partial agonist that binds with high affinity at human 5-HT<sub>4</sub> receptors, whereas it has no appreciable affinity for 5-HT<sub>3</sub> or dopamine receptors. It has moderate affinity for 5-HT<sub>1</sub> receptors. Tegaserod, by acting as an agonist at neuronal 5-HT<sub>4</sub> receptors, triggers the release of further neurotransmitters such as calcitonin gene-related peptide from sensory neurons. The activation of 5-HT<sub>4</sub> receptors in the gastrointestinal tract stimulates the peristaltic reflex and intestinal secretion, as well as inhibits visceral sensitivity."
DB01080,Vigabatrin,CHEMBL89598,"Vigabatrin increases brain concentrations of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), an inhibitory neurotransmitter in the CNS, by irreversibly inhibiting enzymes that catabolize GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid transaminase, GABA-T). Duration of action is determined by rate of GABA-T re-synthesis. Vigabatrin may also work by suppressing repetitive neuronal firing through inhibition of voltage-sensitive sodium channels. Although administered as a racemic mixture, only the S(+) enantiomer is pharmacologically active. "
DB01081,Diphenoxylate,CHEMBL1201294,"Diphenoxylate is an opiate receptor agonists that stimulate mu receptors in GI to decrease the peristalsis and constrict the sphincters. Diphenoxylate has a direct effect on circular smooth muscle of the bowel, that conceivably results in segmentation and prolongation of gastrointestinal transit time. The clinical antidiarrheal action of diphenoxylate may thus be a consequence of enhanced segmentation that allows increased contact of the intraluminal contents with the intestinal mucosa."
DB01082,Streptomycin,CHEMBL372795,"Aminoglycosides like Streptomycin ""irreversibly"" bind to specific 30S-subunit proteins and 16S rRNA. Specifically Streptomycin binds to four nucleotides of 16S rRNA and a single amino acid of protein S12. This interferes with decoding site in the vicinity of nucleotide 1400 in 16S rRNA of 30S subunit. This region interacts with the wobble base in the anticodon of tRNA. This leads to interference with the initiation complex, misreading of mRNA so incorrect amino acids are inserted into the polypeptide leading to nonfunctional or toxic peptides and the breakup of polysomes into nonfunctional monosomes."
DB01083,Orlistat,CHEMBL175247,"Orlistat is a reversible inhibitor of lipases. It exerts its therapeutic activity in the lumen of the stomach and small intestine by forming a covalent bond with the active serine residue site of gastric and pancreatic lipases. The inactivated enzymes are thus unavailable to hydrolyze dietary fat in the form of triglycerides into absorbable free fatty acids and monoglycerides. As undigested triglycerides are not absorbed, the resulting caloric deficit may have a positive effect on weight control."
DB01084,Emedastine,CHEMBL594,"Emedastine is a relatively selective, histamine H<sub>1</sub> antagonist. In vitro examinations of emedastine's affinity for histamine receptors demonstrate relative selectivity for the H<sub>1</sub> histamine receptor. In vivo studies have shown concentration-dependent inhibition of histamine-stimulated vascular permeability in the conjunctiva following topical ocular administration. Emedastine appears to be devoid of effects on adrenergic, dopaminergic and serotonin receptors."
DB01085,Pilocarpine,CHEMBL550,"Pilocarpine is a cholinergic parasympathomimetic agent. It increase secretion by the exocrine glands, and produces contraction of the iris sphincter muscle and ciliary muscle (when given topically to the eyes) by mainly stimulating muscarinic receptors."
DB01086,Benzocaine,CHEMBL278172,Benzocaine binds to sodium channels and reversibly stabilizes the neuronal membrane which decreases its permeability to sodium ions. Depolarization of the neuronal membrane is inhibited thereby blocking the initiation and conduction of nerve impulses.
DB01087,Primaquine,CHEMBL506,"Primaquine's mechanism of action is not well understood. It may be acting by generating reactive oxygen species or by interfering with the electron transport in the parasite. Also, although its mechanism of action is unclear, primaquine may bind to and alter the properties of protozoal DNA."
DB01088,Iloprost,CHEMBL494,"Iloprost is a second generation structural analog of prostacyclin (PGI) with about ten-fold greater potency than the first generation stable analogs, such as carbaprostacyclin. Iloprost binds with equal affinity to human prostacyclin (Prostanoid IP) and prostaglandin EP1 receptors. Iloprost constricts the ilium and fundus circular smooth muscle as strongly as prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) itself. Iloprost inhibits the ADP, thrombin, and collagen-induced aggregation of human platelets. In whole animals, iloprost acts as a vasodilator, hypotensive, antidiuretic, and prolongs bleeding time. All of these properties help to antagonize the pathological changes that take place in the small pulmonary arteries of patients with pulmonary hypertension."
DB01089,Deserpidine,CHEMBL1200515,Deserpidine's mechanism of action is through inhibition of the ATP/Mg<sup>2+</sup> pump responsible for the sequestering of neurotransmitters into storage vesicles located in the presynaptic neuron. The neurotransmitters that are not sequestered in the storage vesicle are readily metabolized by monoamine oxidase (MAO) causing a reduction in catecholamines.
DB01090,Pentolinium,CHEMBL1271,"Pentolinium binds to the nicotinic (ganglion) acetylcholine receptor. This receptor/channel is permeable to a range of divalent cations including calcium, the influx of which may activate a potassium current which hyperpolarizes the cell membrane. Blockage of the receptor leads to smooth muscle relaxation and vasodilaton."
DB01091,Butenafine,CHEMBL990,"Although the  mechanism of action has not been fully established, it has been suggested that butenafine, like allylamines, interferes with sterol biosynthesis (especially ergosterol) by inhibiting squalene monooxygenase, an enzyme responsible for converting squalene to 2,3-oxydo squalene. As ergosterol is an essential component of the fungal cell membrane, inhibition of its synthesis results in increased cellular permeability causing leakage of cellular contents. Blockage of squalene monooxygenase also leads to a subsequent accumulation of squalene. When a high concentration of squalene is reached, it is thought to have an effect of directly kill fungal cells."
DB01092,Ouabain,CHEMBL222863,"Ouabain inhibits the Na-K-ATPase membrane pump, resulting in an increase in intracellular sodium and calcium concentrations. Increased intracellular concentrations of calcium may promote activation of contractile proteins (e.g., actin, myosin).

DB01093,Dimethyl sulfoxide,CHEMBL504,"The mechanism of dimethyl sulfoxide's actions is not well understood. Dimethyl sulfoxide has demonstrated antioxidant activity in certain biological settings. For example, the cardiovascular protective effect of dimethyl sulfoxide in copper-deficient rats is thought to occur by an antioxidant mechanism. It is also thought that dimethyl sulfoxide's possible anti-inflammatory activity is due to antioxidant action."
DB01094,Hesperetin,CHEMBL399121,"Hesperetin reduces or inhibits the activity of acyl-coenzyme A:cholesterol acyltransferase genes (ACAT<sub>1</sub> and ACAT<sub>2</sub>) and it reduces microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) activity. Hesperetin also seems to upregulate the LDL receptor. This leads to the reduced assembly and secretion of apoB-containing lipoproteins and enhanced reuptake of those lipoproteins, thereby lowering cholesterol levels."
DB01095,Fluvastatin,CHEMBL350239,"Fluvastatin selectively and competitively inhibits the hepatic enzyme hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase. HMG-CoA reductase is responsible for converting HMG-CoA to mevalonate, the rate-limiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis. Inhibition results in a decrease in hepatic cholesterol levels which stimulates the synthesis of LDL receptors and increases hepatic uptake of LDL cholesterol. The end result is decreased levels of plasma total and LDL cholesterol. "
DB01096,Oxamniquine,CHEMBL847,"Oxamniquine may associate with an irreversible inhibition of the nucleic acid metabolism of the parasites. A hypothesis has been put forth that the drug is activated by a single step, in which a schistosome sulfotransferase enzyme converts oxamniquine into an ester (probably acetate, phosphate, or sulfate). Subsequently, the ester spontaneously dissociates, the resulting electrophilic reactant is capable of alkylation of schistosome DNA."
DB01097,Leflunomide,CHEMBL960,"Leflunomide is a prodrug that is rapidly and almost completely metabolized following oral administration to its pharmacologically active metabolite, A77 1726. This metabolite is responsible for essentially all of the drug's activity in-vivo. The mechanism of action of leflunomide has not been fully determined, but appears to primarily involve regulation of autoimmune lymphocytes. It has been suggested that leflunomide exerts its immunomodulating effects by preventing the expansion of activated autoimmune lymphocytes via interferences with cell cycle progression. In-vitro data indicates that leflunomide interferes with cell cycle progression by inhibiting dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (a mitochondrial enzyme involved in de novo pyrimidine ribonucleotide uridine monophosphate (rUMP)synthesis) and has antiproliferative activity. Human dihydroorotate dehydrogenase consists of 2 domains: an α/β-barrel domain containing the active site and an α-helical domain that forms a tunnel leading to the active site. A77 1726 binds to the hydrophobic tunnel at a site near the flavin mononucleotide. Inhibition of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase by A77 1726 prevents production of rUMP by the de novo pathway; such inhibition leads to decreased rUMP levels, decreased DNA and RNA synthesis, inhibition of cell proliferation, and G1 cell cycle arrest. It is through this action that leflunomide inhibits autoimmune T-cell proliferation and production of autoantibodies by B cells. Since salvage pathways are expected to sustain cells arrested in the G1 phase, the activity of leflunomide is cytostatic rather than cytotoxic. Other effects that result from reduced rUMP levels include interference with adhesion of activated lymphocytes to the synovial vascular endothelial cells, and increased synthesis of immunosuppressive cytokines such as transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β). Leflunomide is also a tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Tyrosine kinases activate signalling pathways leading to DNA repair, apoptosis and cell proliferation. Inhibition of tyrosine kinases can help to treating cancer by preventing repair of tumor cells. "
DB01098,Rosuvastatin,CHEMBL1496,"Rosuvastatin is a competitive inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase. HMG-CoA reductase catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate, an early rate-limiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis. Rosuvastatin acts primarily in the liver. Decreased hepatic cholesterol concentrations stimulate the upregulation of hepatic low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors which increases hepatic uptake of LDL. Rosuvastatin also inhibits hepatic synthesis of very low density lipoprotein (VLDL). The overall effect is a decrease in plasma LDL and VLDL. 
In vitro and in vivo animal studies also demonstrate that rosuvastatin exerts vasculoprotective effects independent of its lipid-lowering properties. Rosuvastatin exerts an anti-inflammatory effect on rat mesenteric microvascular endothelium by attenuating leukocyte rolling, adherence and transmigration (PMID: 11375257). The drug also modulates nitric oxide synthase (NOS) expression and reduces ischemic-reperfusion injuries in rat hearts (PMID: 15914111). Rosuvastatin increases the bioavailability of nitric oxide (PMID: 11375257, 12031849, 15914111) by upregulating NOS (PMID: 12354446) and by increasing the stability of NOS through post-transcriptional polyadenylation (PMID: 17916773). It is unclear as to how rosuvastatin brings about these effects though they may be due to decreased concentrations of mevalonic acid. 

"
DB01099,Flucytosine,CHEMBL1463,"Although the exact mode of action is unknown, it has been proposed that flucytosine acts directly on fungal organisms by competitive inhibition of purine and pyrimidine uptake and indirectly by intracellular metabolism to 5-fluorouracil. Flucytosine enters the fungal cell via cytosine permease; thus, flucytosine is metabolized to 5-fluorouracil within fungal organisms. The 5-fluorouracil is extensively incorporated into fungal RNA and inhibits synthesis of both DNA and RNA. The result is unbalanced growth and death of the fungal organism. It also appears to be an inhibitor of fungal thymidylate synthase."
DB01100,Pimozide,CHEMBL1423,The ability of pimozide to suppress motor and phonic tics in Tourette's Disorder is thought to be primarily a function of its dopaminergic blocking activity. Pimozide binds and inhibits the dopamine D2 receptor in the CNS. 
DB01101,Capecitabine,CHEMBL1773,"Capecitabine is a prodrug that is selectively tumour-activated to its cytotoxic moiety, fluorouracil, by thymidine phosphorylase, an enzyme found in higher concentrations in many tumors compared to normal tissues or plasma. Fluorouracil is further metabolized to two active metabolites, 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine 5'-monophosphate (FdUMP) and 5-fluorouridine triphosphate (FUTP), within normal and tumour cells. These metabolites cause cell injury by two different mechanisms. First, FdUMP and the folate cofactor, N5-10-methylenetetrahydrofolate, bind to thymidylate synthase (TS) to form a covalently bound ternary complex. This binding inhibits the formation of thymidylate from 2'-deaxyuridylate. Thymidylate is the necessary precursor of thymidine triphosphate, which is essential for the synthesis of DNA, therefore a deficiency of this compound can inhibit cell division. Secondly, nuclear transcriptional enzymes can mistakenly incorporate FUTP in place of uridine triphosphate (UTP) during the synthesis of RNA. This metabolic error can interfere with RNA processing and protein synthesis through the production of fraudulent RNA."
DB01102,Arbutamine,CHEMBL1201251,"Arbutamine is a synthetic catecholamine with positive chronotropic and inotropic properties. The chronotropic (increase in heart rate) and inotropic (increase in force of contraction) effects of arbutamine serve to mimic exercise by increasing cardiac work (producing stress) and provoke myocardial ischemia in patients with compromised coronary arteries. The increase in heart rate caused by arbutamine is thought to limit regional subendocardial perfusion, thereby limiting tissue oxygenation. In functional assays, arbutamine is more selective for beta-adrenergic receptors than for alpha-adrenergic receptors. The beta-agonist activity of arbutamine provides cardiac stress by increasing heart rate, cardiac contractility, and systolic blood pressure. The degree of hypotension that occurs for a given chronotropic activity is less with arbutamine than, for example, with isoproterenol because alpha receptor activity is retained."
DB01103,Quinacrine,CHEMBL7568,"The exact mechanism of antiparasitic action is unknown; however, quinacrine binds to deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) in vitro by intercalation between adjacent base pairs, inhibiting transcription and translation to ribonucleic acid (RNA). Quinacrine does not appear to localize to the nucleus of Giaridia trophozoites, suggesting that DNA binding may not be the primary mechanism of its antimicrobial action. Fluorescence studies using Giardia suggest that the outer membranes may be involved. Quinacrine inhibits succinate oxidation and interferes with electron transport. In addition, by binding to nucleoproteins, quinacrine suppress the lupus erythematous cell factor and acts as a strong inhibitor of cholinesterase."
DB01104,Sertraline,CHEMBL809,"The exact mechanism of action sertraline is not fully known, but the drug appears to selectively inhibit the reuptake of serotonin at the presynaptic membrane. This results in an increased synaptic concentration of serotonin in the CNS, which leads to numerous functional changes associated with enhanced serotonergic neurotransmission. It is suggested that these modifications are responsible for the antidepressant action observed during long term administration of antidepressants. It has also been hypothesized that obsessive-compulsive disorder is caused by the dysregulation of serotonin, as it is treated by sertraline, and the drug corrects this imbalance."
DB01105,Sibutramine,CHEMBL1419,"Sibutramine produces its therapeutic effects by inhibition of norepinephrine (NE), serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT), and to a lesser extent, dopamine reuptake at the neuronal synapse. By inhibiting the reuptake of these neurotransmitters, sibutramine promotes a sense of satiety and decrease in appetite, thereby reducing food intake. Data from animal studies also suggest that sibutramine may also increase energy expenditure through thermogenic effects in both the basal and fed states, but this has not been confirmed in humans. Sibutramine and its major pharmacologically active metabolites (M1 and M2) do not act via release of monoamines. "
DB01106,Levocabastine,CHEMBL1615438,"Levocabastine is a potent, selective histamine H1-receptor antagonist. It works by competing with histamine for H1-receptor sites on effector cells. It thereby prevents, but does not reverse, responses mediated by histamine alone. Levocabastine does not block histamine release but, rather, prevents histamine binding and activity. Levocabastine also binds neurotensin 2 receptors and serves as a neurotensin agonist. This can induce some degree of analgesia."
DB01107,Methyprylon,CHEMBL1200790,"Methyprylon binds at a distinct binding site associated with a Cl<sup>-</sup> ionopore at the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor, increasing the duration of time for which the Cl<sup>-</sup> ionopore is open. The post-synaptic inhibitory effect of GABA in the thalamus is, therefore, prolonged."
DB01108,Trilostane,CHEMBL1200907,"Trilostane produces suppression of the adrenal cortex by inhibiting enzymatic conversion of steroids by 3-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/delta 5,4 ketosteroid isomerase, thus blocking synthesis of adrenal steroids."
DB01109,Heparin,CHEMBL1909300,"Under normal circumstances, antithrombin III (ATIII) inactivates thrombin (factor IIa) and factor Xa. This process occurs at a slow rate. Administered heparin binds reversibly to ATIII and leads to almost instantaneous inactivation of factors IIa and Xa The heparin-ATIII complex can also inactivate factors IX, XI, XII and plasmin. The mechanism of action of heparin is ATIII-dependent. It acts mainly by accelerating the rate of the neutralization of certain activated coagulation factors by antithrombin, but other mechanisms may also be involved. The antithrombotic effect of heparin is well correlated to the inhibition of factor Xa. Heparin is not a thrombolytic or fibrinolytic. It prevents progression of existing clots by inhibiting further clotting. The lysis of existing clots relies on endogenous thrombolytics."
DB01110,Miconazole,CHEMBL91,"Miconazole interacts with 14-&alpha; demethylase, a cytochrome P-450 enzyme necessary to convert lanosterol to ergosterol. As ergosterol is an essential component of the fungal cell membrane, inhibition of its synthesis results in increased cellular permeability causing leakage of cellular contents. Miconazole may also inhibit endogenous respiration, interact with membrane phospholipids, inhibit the transformation of yeasts to mycelial forms, inhibit purine uptake, and impair triglyceride and/or phospholipid biosynthesis."
DB01111,Colistimethate,,"Colistimethate is a surface active agent which penetrates into and disrupts the bacterial cell membrane. Colistimethate is polycationic and has both hydrophobic and lipophilic moieties. It interacts with the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane, changing its permeability. This effect is bactericidal. There is also evidence that polymyxins enter the cell and precipitate cytoplasmic components, primarily ribosomes."
DB01112,Cefuroxime,CHEMBL1436,"Cefuroxime, like the penicillins, is a beta-lactam antibiotic. By binding to specific penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) located inside the bacterial cell wall, it inhibits the third and last stage of bacterial cell wall synthesis. Cell lysis is then mediated by bacterial cell wall autolytic enzymes such as autolysins; it is possible that cefuroxime interferes with an autolysin inhibitor."
DB01113,Papaverine,CHEMBL19224,"Perhaps by its direct vasodilating action on cerebral blood vessels, Papaverine increases cerebral blood flow and decreases cerebral vascular resistance in normal subjects; oxygen consumption is unaltered. These effects may explain the benefit reported from the drug in cerebral vascular encephalopathy."
DB01114,Chlorphenamine,CHEMBL505,"Chlorpheniramine binds to the histamine H1 receptor. This blocks the action of endogenous histamine, which subsequently leads to temporary relief of the negative symptoms brought on by histamine."
DB01115,Nifedipine,CHEMBL193,"Nifedipine decreases arterial smooth muscle contractility and subsequent vasoconstriction by inhibiting the influx of calcium ions through L-type calcium channels. Calcium ions entering the cell through these channels bind to calmodulin. Calcium-bound calmodulin then binds to and activates myosin light chain kinase (MLCK). Activated MLCK catalyzes the phosphorylation of the regulatory light chain subunit of myosin, a key step in muscle contraction. Signal amplification is achieved by calcium-induced calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum through ryanodine receptors. Inhibition of the initial influx of calcium inhibits the contractile processes of smooth muscle cells, causing dilation of the coronary and systemic arteries, increased oxygen delivery to the myocardial tissue, decreased total peripheral resistance, decreased systemic blood pressure, and decreased afterload. The vasodilatory effects of nifedipine result in an overall decrease in blood pressure. "
DB01116,Trimethaphan,CHEMBL1201329,"Trimethaphan is a ganglionic blocking agent prevents stimulation of postsynaptic receptors by competing with acetylcholine for these receptor sites. Additional effects may include direct peripheral vasodilation and release of histamine. Trimethaphan's hypotensive effect is due to reduction in sympathetic tone and vasodilation, and is primarily postural."
DB01117,Atovaquone,CHEMBL1450,"Atovaquone is a hydroxy- 1, 4- naphthoquinone, an analog of ubiquinone, with antipneumocystis activity. The mechanism of action against <i>Pneumocystis carinii</i> has not been fully elucidated. In Plasmodium species, the site of action appears to be the cytochrome bc1 complex (Complex III). Several metabolic enzymes are linked to the mitochondrial electron transport chain via ubiquinone. Inhibition of electron transport by atovaquone will result in indirect inhibition of these enzymes. The ultimate metabolic effects of such blockade may include inhibition of nucleic acid and ATP synthesis. Atovaquone also has been shown to have good <i>in vitro</i> activity against <i>Toxoplasma gondii</i>."
DB01118,Amiodarone,CHEMBL633,The antiarrhythmic effect of amiodarone may be due to at least two major actions. It prolongs the myocardial cell-action potential (phase 3) duration and refractory period and acts as a noncompetitive a- and b-adrenergic inhibitor.
DB01119,Diazoxide,CHEMBL181,"As a diuretic, diazoxide inhibits active chloride reabsorption at the early distal tubule via the Na-Cl cotransporter, resulting in an increase in the excretion of sodium, chloride, and water. Thiazides like diazoxide also inhibit sodium ion transport across the renal tubular epithelium through binding to the thiazide sensitive sodium-chloride transporter. This results in an increase in potassium excretion via the sodium-potassium exchange mechanism. The antihypertensive mechanism of diazoxide is less well understood although it may be mediated through its action on carbonic anhydrases in the smooth muscle or through its action on the large-conductance calcium-activated potassium (KCa) channel, also found in the smooth muscle. As a antihypoglycemic, diazoxide inhibits insulin release from the pancreas, probably by opening potassium channels in the beta cell membrane."
DB01120,Gliclazide,CHEMBL427216,"Gliclazide binds to the &beta; cell sulfonyl urea receptor (SUR1). This binding subsequently blocks the ATP sensitive potassium channels. The binding results in closure of the channels and leads to a resulting decrease in potassium efflux leads to depolarization of the &beta; cells. This opens voltage-dependent calcium channels in the &beta; cell resulting in calmodulin activation, which in turn leads to exocytosis of insulin containing secretorty granules."
DB01121,Phenacemide,CHEMBL918,Phenacemide binds to and blocks neuronal sodium channels or voltage sensitive calcium channels. This blocks or suppresses neuronal depolarization and hypersynchronization. Hypersynchronization is what often causes seizures.
DB01122,Ambenonium,CHEMBL1652,"Ambenonium exerts its actions against myasthenia gravis by competitive, reversible inhibition of acetylcholinesterase. The disease myasthenia gravis occurs when the body inappropriately produces antibodies against acetylcholine receptors, and thus inhibits proper acetylcholine signal transmission (when acetylcholine binds to acetylcholine receptors of striated muscle fibers, it stimulates those fibers to contract). Ambenonium reversibly binds acetylcholinesterase at the anionic site, which results in the blockage of the site of acetycholine binding, thereby inhibiting acetylcholine hydrolysis and enhancing cholinergic function through the accumulation of acetycholine at cholinergic synpases. In turn this facilitates transmission of impulses across the myoneural junction and effectively treats the disease."
DB01123,Proflavine,CHEMBL55400,"Proflavine acts by interchelating DNA (intercalation), thereby disrupting DNA synthesis and leading to high levels of mutation in the copied DNA strands. This prevents bacterial reproduction."

Sulfonylureas inhibit the ATP-potassium channels on the beta cell membrane and potassium efflux, which results in depolarization and calcium influx, calcium-calmodulin binding, kinase activation, and release of insulin-containing granules by exocytosis, an effect similar to that of glucose."
DB01125,Anisindione,CHEMBL712,"Like phenindione, to which it is related chemically, anisindione exercises its therapeutic action by reducing the prothrombin activity of the blood. Anisindione prevents the formation of active procoagulation factors II, VII, IX, and X, as well as the anticoagulant proteins C and S, in the liver by inhibiting the vitamin K&ndash;mediated gamma-carboxylation of precursor proteins. Anisindione has no direct thrombolytic effect and does not reverse ischemic tissue damage, although it may limit extension of existing thrombi and prevent secondary thromboembolic complications."
DB01126,Dutasteride,CHEMBL1200969,"Dutasteride inhibits the conversion of testosterone to 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone (DHT), which is the androgen primarily responsible for the initial development and subsequent enlargement of the prostate gland. Testosterone is converted to DHT by the enzyme 5 alpha-reductase, which exists as 2 isoforms, type 1 and type 2. Dutasteride is a competitive and specific inhibitor of both type 1 and type 2 5 alpha-reductase isoenzymes, with which it forms a stable enzyme complex. Dissociation from this complex has been evaluated under <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> conditions and is extremely slow. Dutasteride does not bind to the human androgen receptor."

DB01129,Rabeprazole,CHEMBL1219,"Rabeprazole belongs to a class of antisecretory compounds (substituted benzimidazole proton-pump inhibitors) that do not exhibit anticholinergic or histamine H2-receptor antagonist properties, but suppress gastric acid secretion by inhibiting the gastric H<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>ATPase (hydrogen-potassium adenosine triphosphatase) at the secretory surface of the gastric parietal cell. Because this enzyme is regarded as the acid (proton) pump within the parietal cell, rabeprazole has been characterized as a gastric proton-pump inhibitor. Rabeprazole blocks the final step of gastric acid secretion. In gastric parietal cells, rabeprazole is protonated, accumulates, and is transformed to an active sulfenamide. When studied in vitro, rabeprazole is chemically activated at pH 1.2 with a half-life of 78 seconds."

In general, the mechanism of the anti-inflammatory activity of topical steroids is unclear. However, corticosteroids are thought to act by the induction of phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins, collectively called lipocortins. It is postulated that these proteins control the biosynthesis of potent mediators of inflammation such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes by inhibiting the release of their common precursor arachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid is released from membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A2."
DB01131,Proguanil,CHEMBL1377,"Proguanil inhibits the dihydrofolate reductase of plasmodia and thereby blocks the biosynthesis of purines and pyrimidines, which are essential for DNA synthesis and cell multiplication. This leads to failure of nuclear division at the time of schizont formation in erythrocytes and liver."
DB01132,Pioglitazone,CHEMBL595,"Pioglitazone acts as a selective agonist at Peroxisome Proliferator Activated Receptor Gamma (PPARγ) in target tissues for insulin action such as adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, and liver. Activation of PPAR-gamma receptors increases the transcription of insulin-responsive genes involved in the control of glucose production, transport, and utilization. In this way, pioglitazone both enhances tissue sensitivity to insulin and reduces the production of glucose via the liver (hepatic gluconeogenesis). Thus, insulin resistance associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus is improved without an increase in insulin secretion by pancreatic β cells."
DB01133,Tiludronic acid,CHEMBL1350,"The bisphosphonate group binds strongly to the bone mineral, hydroxyapatite. This explains the specific pharmacological action of these compounds on mineralized tissues, especially bone. <i>In vitro</i> studies indicate that tiludronate acts primarily on bone through a mechanism that involves inhibition of osteoclastic activity with a probable reduction in the enzymatic and transport processes that lead to resorption of the mineralized matrix. Bone resorption occurs following recruitment, activation, and polarization of osteoclasts. Tiludronate appears to inhibit osteoclasts by at least two mechanisms: disruption of the cytoskeletal ring structure, possibly by inhibition of protein-tyrosine-phosphatase, thus leading to detachment of osteoclasts from the bone surface and the inhibition of the osteoclastic proton pump."
DB01134,Desoxycorticosterone Pivalate,CHEMBL1200592,"Desoxycorticosterone Pivalate binds to the mineralocorticoid receptor. Mineralocorticoids are a family of steroids, secreted by the adrenal cortex, necessary for the regulation of a number of metabolic processes including electrolyte regulation. Desoxycorticosterone pivalate exerts its effect through its interaction with the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), whereby it reacts with the receptor proteins to form a steroid-receptor complex. This complex moves into the nucleus, where it binds to chromatin which results in genetic transcription of cellular DNA to messenger RNA. The steroid hormones appear to induce transcription and synthesis of specific proteins, which produce the physiological effects seen after administration."
DB01135,Doxacurium chloride,CHEMBL1237099,"Doxacurium chloride binds competitively to cholinergic receptors on the motor end-plate to antagonize the action of acetylcholine, resulting in a block of neuromuscular transmission (non-depolarizing). This action is antagonized by acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, such as neostigmine."
DB01136,Carvedilol,CHEMBL723,"Carvedilol is a racemic mixture in which nonselective beta-adrenoreceptor blocking activity is present in the S(-) enantiomer and alpha-adrenergic blocking activity is present in both R(+) and S(-) enantiomers at equal potency. Carvedilol's beta-adrenergic receptor blocking ability decreases the heart rate, myocardial contractility, and myocardial oxygen demand. Carvedilol also decreases systemic vascular resistance via its alpha adrenergic receptor blocking properties. Carvedilol and its metabolite BM-910228 (a less potent beta blocker, but more potent antioxidant) have been shown to restore the inotropic responsiveness to Ca<sup>2+</sup> in OH<sup>-</sup> free radical-treated myocardium. Carvedilol and its metabolites also prevent OH<sup>-</sup> radical-induced decrease in sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase activity. Therefore, carvedilol and its metabolites may be beneficial in chronic heart failure by preventing free radical damage."
DB01137,Levofloxacin,CHEMBL33,"Levofloxacin inhibits bacterial type II topoisomerases, topoisomerase IV and DNA gyrase. Levofloxacin, like other fluoroquinolones, inhibits the A subunits of DNA gyrase, two subunits encoded by the gyrA gene. This results in strand breakage on a bacterial chromosome, supercoiling, and resealing; DNA replication and transcription is inhibited."
DB01138,Sulfinpyrazone,CHEMBL832,"Sulfinpyrazone is an oral uricosuric agent (pyrazolone derivative) used to treat chronic or intermittent gouty arthritis. Sulfinpyrazone competitively inhibits the reabsorption of uric acid at the proximal convoluted tubule, thereby facilitating urinary excretion of uric acid and decreasing plasma urate concentrations.  This is likely done through inhibition of the urate anion transporter (hURAT1) as well as the human organic anion transporter 4 (hOAT4). Sulfinpyrazone is not intended for the treatment of acute attacks because it lacks therapeutically useful analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects. Sulfinpyrazone and its sulfide metabolite possess COX inhibitory effects. Sulfinpyrazone has also been shown to be a UDP-glucuronsyltransferase inhibitor and a very potent CYP2C9 inhibitor.  Sulfinpyrazone is also known to be a cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) inhibitor as well as an inhibitor of several multridrug resistance proteins (MRPs).  "

DB01140,Cefadroxil,CHEMBL1644,"Like all beta-lactam antibiotics, cefadroxil binds to specific penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) located inside the bacterial cell wall, causing the inhibition of the third and last stage of bacterial cell wall synthesis. Cell lysis is then mediated by bacterial cell wall autolytic enzymes such as autolysins; it is possible that cefadroxil interferes with an autolysin inhibitor."
DB01141,Micafungin,CHEMBL457547,"Micafungin inhibits the synthesis of beta-1,3-D-glucan, an essential component of fungal cell walls which is not present in mammalian cells. It does this by inhibiting beta-1,3-D-glucan synthase."
DB01142,Doxepin,CHEMBL101740,"The mechanism of action of doxepin is not completely understood. It is thought that like amitriptyline, doxepin enhances the actions of norepinephrine and serotonin by blocking their reuptake at the neuronal membrane. However, doxepin weakly inhibits the reuptake of dopamine. Doxepin may also act on histamine H<sub>1</sub>-receptors, resulting in sedative effects, and &beta;-adrenergic receptors. It is also an antagonist of 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin) receptors, alpha-1 adrenergic receptor, and muscarinic cholinergic receptors. "
DB01143,Amifostine,CHEMBL1006,"The thiol metabolite is responsible for most of the cytoprotective and radioprotective properties of amifostine. It is readily taken up by cells where it binds to and detoxifies reactive metabolites of platinum and alkylating agents as well as scavenges free radicals. Other possible effects include inhibition of apoptosis, alteration of gene expression and modification of enzyme activity."
DB01144,Diclofenamide,CHEMBL17,"Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors reduce intraocular pressure by partially suppressing the secretion of aqueous humor (inflow), although the mechanism by which they do this is not fully understood. Evidence suggests that HCO<sup>3-</sup> ions are produced in the ciliary body by hydration of carbon dioxide under the influence of carbonic anhydrase and diffuse into the posterior chamber which contains more Na<sup>+</sup> and HCO<sup>3-</sup> ions than does plasma and consequently is hypertonic. Water is then attracted to the posterior chamber by osmosis, resulting in a drop in pressure."
DB01145,Sulfoxone,CHEMBL1570,"Sulfoxone is a competitive inhibitor of bacterial enzyme dihydropteroate synthetase. The normal substrate for the enzyme, para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) cannot bind as usual. The inhibited reaction is necessary in these organisms for the synthesis of folic acid."
DB01146,Diphenylpyraline,CHEMBL1492,"Antihistamines such as diphenylpyraline used in the treatment of allergy act by competing with histamine for H1-receptor sites on effector cells. This reduces the effects of histamine, leading to a temporary reduction of allergy symptoms."
DB01147,Cloxacillin,CHEMBL891,"By binding to specific penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) located inside the bacterial cell wall, cloxacillin inhibits the third and last stage of bacterial cell wall synthesis. Cell lysis is then mediated by bacterial cell wall autolytic enzymes such as autolysins; it is possible that cloxacillin interferes with an autolysin inhibitor."
DB01148,Flavoxate,CHEMBL1493,"Flavoxate acts as a direct antagonist at muscarinic acetylcholine receptors in cholinergically innervated organs. Its anticholinergic-parasympatholytic action reduces the tonus of smooth muscle in the bladder, effectively reducing the number of required voids, urge incontinence episodes, urge severity and improving retention, facilitating increased volume per void."
DB01149,Nefazodone,CHEMBL623,"Within the serotonergic system, nefazodone acts as an antagonist at type 2 serotonin (5-HT<sub>2</sub>) post-synaptic receptors and, like fluoxetine-type antidepressants, inhibits pre-synaptic serotonin (5-HT) reuptake. These mechanisms increase the amount of serotonin available to interact with 5-HT receptors. Within the noradrenergic system, nefazodone inhibits norepinephrine uptake minimally. Nefazodone also antagonizes alpha(1)-adrenergic receptors, producing sedation, muscle relaxation, and a variety of cardiovascular effects. Nefazodone's affinity for benzodiazepine, cholinergic, dopaminergic, histaminic, and beta or alpha(2)-adrenergic receptors is not significant."
DB01150,Cefprozil,CHEMBL276568,"Cefprozil, like the penicillins, is a beta-lactam antibiotic. By binding to specific penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) located inside the bacterial cell wall, it inhibits the third and last stage of bacterial cell wall synthesis. Cell lysis is then mediated by bacterial cell wall autolytic enzymes such as autolysins; it is possible that cefprozil interferes with an autolysin inhibitor."
DB01151,Desipramine,CHEMBL72,"Desipramine is a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) that selectively blocks reuptake of norepinephrine (noradrenaline) from the neuronal synapse. It also inhibits serotonin reuptake, but to a lesser extent compared to tertiary amine TCAs such as imipramine. Inhibition of neurotransmitter reuptake increases stimulation of the post-synaptic neuron.  Chronic use of desipramine also leads to down-regulation of beta-adrenergic receptors in the cerebral cortex and sensitization of serotonergic receptors. An overall increase in serotonergic transmission likely confers desipramine its antidepressant effects. Desipramine also possesses minor anticholinergic activity, through its affinity for muscarinic receptors. TCAs are believed to act by restoring normal levels of neurotransmitters via synaptic reuptake inhibition and by increasing serotonergic neurotransmission via serotonergic receptor sensitization in the central nervous system."
DB01152,Candicidin,CHEMBL1200647,"Ergosterol, the principal sterol in the fungal cytoplasmic membrane, is the target site of action of Candicidin. Candicidin binds irreversibly to ergosterol, resulting in disruption of membrane integrity and ultimately cell death. There is some evidence that the binding site in the cell wall may be to fatty acids or fatty acid esters and that this binding capacity must be satisfied before candicidin can bring about its lethal effect by binding to sterol in the cell membrane."
DB01153,Sertaconazole,CHEMBL1201196,"Sertaconazole interacts with 14-&alpha; demethylase, a cytochrome P-450 enzyme necessary to convert lanosterol to ergosterol. As ergosterol is an essential component of the fungal cell membrane, inhibition of its synthesis results in increased cellular permeability causing leakage of cellular contents. Sertaconazole may also inhibit endogenous respiration, interact with membrane phospholipids, inhibit the transformation of yeasts to mycelial forms, inhibit purine uptake, and impair triglyceride and/or phospholipid biosynthesis."
DB01154,Thiamylal,CHEMBL440,"Thiamylal binds at a distinct binding site associated with a Cl<sup>-</sup> ionopore at the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor, increasing the duration of time for which the Cl<sup>-</sup> ionopore is open. The post-synaptic inhibitory effect of GABA in the thalamus is, therefore, prolonged."
DB01155,Gemifloxacin,CHEMBL430,"The bactericidal action of gemifloxacin results from inhibition of the enzymes topoisomerase II (DNA gyrase) and topoisomerase IV, which are required for bacterial DNA replication, transcription, repair, and recombination."
DB01156,Bupropion,CHEMBL894,"Bupropion selectively inhibits the neuronal reuptake of dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin; actions on dopaminergic systems are more significant than imipramine or amitriptyline whereas the blockade of norepinephrine and serotonin reuptake at the neuronal membrane is weaker for bupropion than for tricyclic antidepressants. The increase in norepinephrine may attenuate nicotine withdrawal symptoms and the increase in dopamine at neuronal sites may reduce nicotine cravings and the urge to smoke. Bupropion exhibits moderate anticholinergic effects."
DB01157,Trimetrexate,CHEMBL119,"In vitro studies have shown that trimetrexate is a competitive inhibitor of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) from bacterial, protozoan, and mammalian sources. DHFR catalyzes the reduction of intracellular dihydrofolate to the active coenzyme tetrahydrofolate. Inhibition of DHFR results in the depletion of this coenzyme, leading directly to interference with thymidylate biosynthesis, as well as inhibition of folate-dependent formyltransferases, and indirectly to inhibition of p.r.n. biosynthesis. The end result is disruption of DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis, with consequent cell death."
DB01158,Bretylium,CHEMBL1199080,"Bretylium inhibits norepinephrine release by depressing adrenergic nerve terminal excitability. The mechanisms of the antifibrillatory and antiarrhythmic actions of bretylium are not established. In efforts to define these mechanisms, the following electrophysiologic actions of bretylium have been demonstrated in animal experiments: increase in ventricular fibrillation threshold, increase in action potential duration and effective refractory period without changes in heart rate, little effect on the rate of rise or amplitude of the cardiac action potential (Phase 0) or in resting membrane potential (Phase 4) in normal myocardium, decrease in the disparity in action potential duration between normal and infarcted regions, and increase in impulse formation and spontaneous firing rate of pacemaker tissue as well as increase ventricular conduction velocity."
DB01159,Halothane,CHEMBL931,"Halothane causes general anaethesia due to its actions on multiple ion channels, which ultimately depresses nerve conduction, breathing, cardiac contractility. Its immobilizing effects have been attributed to its binding to potassium channels in cholinergic neurons. Halothane's effect are also likely due to binding to NMDA and calcium channels, causing hyperpolarization."
DB01160,Dinoprost Tromethamine,CHEMBL1200896,"Dinoprost tromethamine appears to act directly on the myometrium, but this has not been completely established. Dinoprost stimulates myometrial contractions (via its interaction with the prostaglandin receptors) in the gravid uterus that are similar to the contractions that occur in the term uterus during labor. These contractions are usually sufficient to cause abortion. Uterine response to prostaglandins increases gradually throughout pregnancy. Dinoprost also facilitates cervical dilatation and softening."
DB01161,Chloroprocaine,CHEMBL1179047,"Chloroprocaine acts mainly by inhibiting sodium influx through voltage gated sodium channels in the neuronal cell membrane of peripheral nerves. When the influx of sodium is interrupted, an action potential cannot arise and signal conduction is thus inhibited. The receptor site is thought to be located at the cytoplasmic (inner) portion of the sodium channel. It is hypothesized that Chloroprocaine binds or antagonizes the function of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors as well as nicotinic acetylcholine receptors and the serotonin receptor-ion channel complex."
DB01162,Terazosin,CHEMBL611,"In general, &alpha;<sub>1</sub>-adrenergic receptors mediate contraction and hypertrophic growth of smooth muscle cells. &alpha;<sub>1</sub>-Receptors are 7-transmembrane domain receptors coupled to G proteins, G<sub>q/11</sub>. Three &alpha;<sub>1</sub>-receptor subtypes, which share approximately 75% homology in their transmembrane domains, have been identified: &alpha;<sub>1A</sub> (chromosome 8), &alpha;<sub>1B</sub> (chromosome 5), and &alpha;<sub>1D</sub> (chromosome 20). Terazosin is the first &alpha;<sub>1</sub>-receptor antagonist to demonstrate selectivity for the &alpha;<sub>1A</sub>-receptor.  All three receptor subtypes appear to be involved in maintaining vascular tone. The &alpha;<sub>1A</sub>-receptor maintains basal vascular tone while the &alpha;<sub>1B</sub>-receptor mediates the vasocontrictory effects of exogenous &alpha;<sub>1</sub>-agonists. Activation of &alpha;<sub>1</sub>-receptors activates G<sub>q</sub>-proteins, which results in intracellular stimulation of phospholipases C, A<sub>2</sub>, and D. This results in mobilization of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from intracellular stores, activation of mitogen-activated kinase and PI<sub>3</sub> kinase pathways and subsequent vasoconstriction. Terozosin produces its pharmacological effects by inhibiting &alpha;<sub>1A</sub>-receptor activation. Inhibition of these receptors in the vasculature and prostate results in muscle relaxation, decreased blood pressure and improved urinary outflow in symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia."
DB01163,Amdinocillin,CHEMBL530,"Amdinocillin is a stong and specific antagonist of Penicillin Binding Protein-2 (PBP 2). It is active against gram negative bacteria, preventing cell wall synthesis by inhibiting the activity of PBP2. PBP2 is a peptidoglycan elongation initiating enzyme. Peptidoglycan is a polymer of sugars and amino acids that is the main component of bacterial cell walls. "
DB01164,Calcium Chloride,CHEMBL1200668,"Calcium chloride in water dissociates to provide calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) and chloride (Cl<sup>-</sup>) ions. They are normal constituents of the body fluids and are dependent on various physiological mechanisms for maintenance of balance between intake and output. For hyperkalemia, the influx of calcium helps restore the normal gradient between threshold potential and resting membrane potential."
DB01165,Ofloxacin,CHEMBL4,"Ofloxacin acts on DNA gyrase and toposiomerase IV, enzymes which, like human topoisomerase, prevents the excessive supercoiling of DNA during replication or transcription. By inhibiting their function, the drug thereby inhibits normal cell division."
DB01166,Cilostazol,CHEMBL799,"Cilostazol and several of its metabolites are cyclic AMP (cAMP) phosphodiesterase III inhibitors (PDE III inhibitors), inhibiting phosphodiesterase activity and suppressing cAMP degradation with a resultant increase in cAMP in platelets and blood vessels, leading to inhibition of platelet aggregation and vasodilation."
DB01167,Itraconazole,CHEMBL22587,"Itraconazole interacts with 14-&alpha; demethylase, a cytochrome P-450 enzyme necessary to convert lanosterol to ergosterol. As ergosterol is an essential component of the fungal cell membrane, inhibition of its synthesis results in increased cellular permeability causing leakage of cellular contents. Itraconazole may also inhibit endogenous respiration, interact with membrane phospholipids, inhibit the transformation of yeasts to mycelial forms, inhibit purine uptake, and impair triglyceride and/or phospholipid biosynthesis."
DB01168,Procarbazine,CHEMBL1321,"The precise mode of cytotoxic action of procarbazine has not been clearly defined. There is evidence that the drug may act by inhibition of protein, RNA and DNA synthesis. Studies have suggested that procarbazine may inhibit transmethylation of methyl groups of methionine into t-RNA. The absence of functional t-RNA could cause the cessation of protein synthesis and consequently DNA and RNA synthesis. In addition, procarbazine may directly damage DNA. Hydrogen peroxide, formed during the auto-oxidation of the drug, may attack protein sulfhydryl groups contained in residual protein which is tightly bound to DNA."
DB01169,Arsenic trioxide,CHEMBL1200978,The mechanism of action of Arsenic Trioxide is not completely understood. Arsenic trioxide causes morphological changes and DNA fragmentation characteristic of apoptosis in NB4 human promyelocytic leukemia cells <i>in vitro</i>. Arsenic trioxide also causes damage or degradation of the fusion protein PML/RAR-alpha. It is suspected that arsenic trioxide induces cancer cells to undergo apoptosis.
DB01170,Guanethidine,CHEMBL765,"Guanethidine acts at the sympathetic neuroeffector junction by inhibiting or interfering with the release and/or distribution of norepinephrine, rather than acting at the effector cell by inhibiting the association of norepinephrine with its receptors. It is taken up by norepinephrine transporters. It becomes concentrated in NE transmitter vesicles, replacing NE in these vesicles. This leads to a gradual depletion of NE stores in the nerve endings. Once inside the terminal it blocks the release of noradrenaline in response to arrival of an action potential. In contrast to ganglionic blocking agents, Guanethidine suppresses equally the responses mediated by alpha-and beta-adrenergic receptors but does not produce parasympathetic blockade. Since sympathetic blockade results in modest decreases in peripheral resistance and cardiac output, Guanethidine lowers blood pressure in the supine position. It further reduces blood pressure by decreasing the degree of vasoconstriction that normally results from reflex sympathetic nervous activity upon assumption of the upright posture, thus reducing venous return and cardiac output more."
DB01171,Moclobemide,CHEMBL86304,"The mechanism of action of moclobemide involves the selective, reversible inhibition of MAO-A. This inhibition leads to a decrease in the metabolism and destruction of monoamines in the neurotransmitters. This results in an increase in the monoamines, relieving depressive symptoms."
DB01172,Kanamycin,CHEMBL1384,"Aminoglycosides like kanamycin ""irreversibly"" bind to specific 30S-subunit proteins and 16S rRNA. Specifically Kanamycin binds to four nucleotides of 16S rRNA and a single amino acid of protein S12. This interferes with decoding site in the vicinity of nucleotide 1400 in 16S rRNA of 30S subunit. This region interacts with the wobble base in the anticodon of tRNA. This leads to interference with the initiation complex, misreading of mRNA so incorrect amino acids are inserted into the polypeptide leading to nonfunctional or toxic peptides and the breakup of polysomes into nonfunctional monosomes."
DB01173,Orphenadrine,CHEMBL900,"Orphenadrine binds and inhibits both histamine H1 receptors and NMDA receptors. It restores the motor disturbances induced by neuroleptics, in particular the hyperkinesia. The dopamine deficiency in the striatum increases the stimulating effects of the cholinergic system. This stimulation is counteracted by the anticholinergic effect of orphenadrine. It may have a relaxing effect on skeletal muscle spasms and it has a mood elevating effect."
DB01174,Phenobarbital,CHEMBL40,"Phenobarbital acts on GABAA receptors, increasing synaptic inhibition. This has the effect of elevating seizure threshold and reducing the spread of seizure activity from a seizure focus. Phenobarbital may also inhibit calcium channels, resulting in a decrease in excitatory transmitter release. The sedative-hypnotic effects of phenobarbital are likely the result of its effect on the polysynaptic midbrain reticular formation, which controls CNS arousal."
DB01175,Escitalopram,CHEMBL1508,"The antidepressant, antiobsessive-compulsive, and antibulimic actions of escitalopram are presumed to be linked to its inhibition of CNS neuronal uptake of serotonin. Escitalopram blocks the reuptake of serotonin at the serotonin reuptake pump of the neuronal membrane, enhancing the actions of serotonin on 5HT<sub>1A</sub> autoreceptors. SSRIs bind with significantly less affinity to histamine, acetylcholine, and norepinephrine receptors than tricyclic antidepressant drugs."
DB01176,Cyclizine,CHEMBL648,"Vomiting (emesis) is essentially a protective mechanism for removing irritant or otherwise harmful substances from the upper GI tract. Emesis or vomiting is controlled by the vomiting centre in the medulla region of the brain, an important part of which is the chemotrigger zone (CTZ). The vomiting centre possesses neurons which are rich in muscarinic cholinergic and histamine containing synapses. These types of neurons are especially involved in transmission from the vestibular apparatus to the vomiting centre. Motion sickness principally involves overstimulation of these pathways due to various sensory stimuli. Hence the action of cyclizine which acts to block the histamine receptors in the vomiting centre and thus reduce activity along these pathways. Furthermore since cyclizine possesses anti-cholinergic properties as well, the muscarinic receptors are similarly blocked."
DB01177,Idarubicin,CHEMBL1117,"Idarubicin has antimitotic and cytotoxic activity through a number of proposed mechanisms of action: Idarubicin forms complexes with DNA by intercalation between base pairs, and it inhibits topoisomerase II activity by stabilizing the DNA-topoisomerase II complex, preventing the religation portion of the ligation-religation reaction that topoisomerase II catalyzes."
DB01178,Chlormezanone,CHEMBL1200714,"Chlormezanone binds to central benzodiazepine receptors which interact allosterically with GABA receptors. This potentiates the effects of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA, increasing the inhibition of the ascending reticular activating system and blocking the cortical and limbic arousal that occurs following stimulation of the reticular pathways."
DB01179,Podofilox,CHEMBL61,"The exact mechanism of action is not well understood. It does appear, however, that it and its derivatives may bind and inhibit topoisomerase II during the late S and early G2 stage. The drug may bind and stabilize the temporary break caused by the enzyme. This disrupts the reparation of the break through which the double-stranded DNA passes, and consequently stops DNA unwinding and replication"
DB01180,Rescinnamine,CHEMBL1668,"Rescinnamine Binds to and inhibits the angiotensin converting enzyme. Rescinnamine competes with angiotensin I for binding at the angiotensin-converting enzyme, blocking the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II. Inhibition of ACE results in decreased plasma angiotensin II. As angiotensin II is a vasoconstrictor and a negative-feedback mediator for renin activity, lower concentrations result in a decrease in blood pressure and stimulation of baroreceptor reflex mechanisms, which leads to decreased vasopressor activity and to decreased aldosterone secretion."
DB01181,Ifosfamide,CHEMBL1024,"The exact mechanism of ifosfamide has not been determined, but appears to be similar to other alkylating agents. Ifosfamide requires biotransformation in the liver by mixed-function  oxidases (cytochrome P450 system) before it becomes active. After metabolic activation, active metabolites of ifosfamide alkylate or bind with many intracellular molecular structures, including nucleic acids. The cytotoxic action is primarily through the alkylation of DNA, done by attaching the N-7 position of guanine to its reactive electrophilic groups. The formation of inter and intra strand cross-links in the DNA results in cell death."
DB01182,Propafenone,CHEMBL631,"The electrophysiological effect of propafenone manifests itself in a reduction of upstroke velocity (Phase 0) of the monophasic action potential. In Purkinje fibers, and to a lesser extent myocardial fibers, propafenone reduces the fast inward current carried by sodium ions, which is responsible for the drugs antiarrhythmic actions. Diastolic excitability threshold is increased and effective refractory period prolonged. Propafenone reduces spontaneous automaticity and depresses triggered activity. At very high concentrations in vitro, propafenone can inhibit the slow inward current carried by calcium but this calcium antagonist effect probably does not contribute to antiarrhythmic efficacy."
DB01183,Naloxone,CHEMBL80,"While the mechanism of action of naloxone is not fully understood, the preponderance of evidence suggests that naloxone antagonizes the opioid effects by competing for the same receptor sites, especially the mu-opioid receptor. Recently, naloxone has been shown to bind all three opioid receptors (mu, kappa and gamma) but the strongest binding is to the mu receptor."
DB01184,Domperidone,CHEMBL219916,"Domperidone acts as a gastrointestinal emptying (delayed) adjunct and peristaltic stimulant. The gastroprokinetic properties of domperidone are related to its peripheral dopamine receptor blocking properties. Domperidone facilitates gastric emptying and decreases small bowel transit time by increasing esophageal and gastric peristalsis and by lowering esophageal sphincter pressure. Antiemetic: The antiemetic properties of domperidone are related to its dopamine receptor blocking activity at both the chemoreceptor trigger zone and at the gastric level. It has strong affinities for the D2 and D3 dopamine receptors, which are found in the chemoreceptor trigger zone, located just outside the blood brain barrier, which - among others - regulates nausea and vomiting"
DB01185,Fluoxymesterone,CHEMBL1445,"Fluoxymesterone is a synthetic androgenic anabolic steroid and is approximately 5 times as potent as natural methyltestosterone. Like testosterone and other androgenic hormones, fluoxymesterone binds to the androgen receptor. It produces retention of nitrogen, sodium, potassium, and phosphorus; increases protein anabolism; decreases amino acid catabolism and decreased urinary excretion of calcium. The antitumour activity of fluoxymesterone appears related to reduction or competitive inhibition of prolactin receptors or estrogen receptors or production."
DB01186,Pergolide,CHEMBL531,"The dopamine D<sub>2</sub> receptor is a 7-transmembrane G-protein coupled receptor associated with G<sub>i</sub> proteins. In lactotrophs, stimulation of dopamine D<sub>2</sub> receptor causes inhibition of adenylyl cyclase, which decreases intracellular cAMP concentrations and blocks IP3-dependent release of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from intracellular stores. Decreases in intracellular calcium levels may also be brought about via inhibition of calcium influx through voltage-gated calcium channels, rather than via inhibition of adenylyl cyclase. Additionally, receptor activation blocks phosphorylation of p42/p44 MAPK and decreases MAPK/ERK kinase phosphorylation. Inhibition of MAPK appears to be mediated by c-Raf and B-Raf-dependent inhibition of MAPK/ERK kinase. Dopamine-stimulated growth hormone release from the pituitary gland is mediated by a decrease in intracellular calcium influx through voltage-gated calcium channels rather than via adenylyl cyclase inhibition. Stimulation of dopamine D<sub>2</sub> receptors in the nigrostriatal pathway leads to improvements in coordinated muscle activity in those with movement disorders. "
DB01187,Iophendylate,CHEMBL951,Iophendylate has been shown to be both a radiographic and magnetic resonance (MR) contrast agent in patients with suspected cord abnormalities who underwent MR examination following myelography. The iophendylate appears as a linear band of high signal intensity along the dependent portion of the spinal canal on MR images obtained with a repetition time of 500 msec and an echo time of 30 msec.
DB01188,Ciclopirox,CHEMBL1413,"Unlike antifungals such as itraconazole and terbinafine, which affect sterol synthesis, ciclopirox is thought to act through the chelation of polyvalent metal cations, such as Fe<sup>3+</sup> and Al<sup>3+</sup>. These cations inhibit many enzymes, including cytochromes, thus disrupting cellular activities such as mitochondrial electron transport processes and energy production. Ciclopirox also appears to modify the plasma membrane of fungi, resulting in the disorganization of internal structures. The anti-inflammatory action of ciclopirox is most likely due to inhibition of 5-lipoxygenase and cyclooxygenase.
ciclopirox may exert its effect by disrupting DNA repair, cell division signals and structures (mitotic spindles) as well as some elements of intracellular transport. "
DB01189,Desflurane,CHEMBL1200733,"Desflurane induces a reduction in junctional conductance by decreasing gap junction channel opening times and increasing gap junction channel closing times. Desflurane also activates calcium dependent ATPase in the sarcoplasmic reticulum by increasing the fluidity of the lipid membrane. It also appears to bind the D subunit of ATP synthase and NADH dehydogenase. Desflurane also binds to and agonizes the GABA receptor, the large conductance Ca<sup>2+</sup> activated potassium channel, the glycine receptors, and antagonizes the glutamate receptors. "
DB01190,Clindamycin,CHEMBL1753,"Systemic/vaginal clindamycin inhibits protein synthesis of bacteria by binding to the 50S ribosomal subunits of the bacteria.

Topical clindamycin reduces free fatty acid concentrations on the skin and suppresses the growth of Propionibacterium acnes (Corynebacterium acnes) , an anaerobe found in sebaceous glands and follicles."
DB01191,Dexfenfluramine,CHEMBL248702,Dexfenfluramine binds to the serotonin reuptake pump. This causes inhbition of serotonin reuptake. The increased levels of serotonin lead to greater serotonin receptor activation which in turn lead to enhancement of serotoninergic transmission in the centres of feeding behavior located in the hypothalamus. This suppresses the appetite for carbohydrates.
DB01192,Oxymorphone,CHEMBL963,"Oxymorphone interacts predominantly with the opioid mu-receptor. These mu-binding sites are discretely distributed in the human brain, with high densities in the posterior amygdala, hypothalamus, thalamus, nucleus caudatus, putamen, and certain cortical areas. They are also found on the terminal axons of primary afferents within laminae I and II (substantia gelatinosa) of the spinal cord and in the spinal nucleus of the trigeminal nerve. Also, it has been shown that oxymorphone binds to and inhibits GABA inhibitory interneurons via mu-receptors. These interneurons normally inhibit the descending pain inhibition pathway. So, without the inhibitory signals, pain modulation can proceed downstream."
DB01193,Acebutolol,CHEMBL642,"Acebutolol is a selective &beta;1-receptor antagonist. Activation of &beta;1-receptors by epinephrine increases the heart rate and the blood pressure, and the heart consumes more oxygen. Acebutolol blocks these receptors, lowering the heart rate and blood pressure. This drug then has the reverse effect of epinephrine. In addition, beta blockers prevent the release of renin, which is a hormone produced by the kidneys which leads to constriction of blood vessels."
DB01194,Brinzolamide,CHEMBL220491,"Brinzolamide is a highly specific inhibitor of CA-II, which is the main CA isoenzyme involved in the secretion of aqueous humor. Inhibition of CA in the ciliary process of the eye slows the formation of bicarbonate, and reduces sodium and fluid transport. This results in a reduction in the rate of aqueous humor secretion and the intraocular pressure. Brinzolamide is absorbed systemically following topical ocular administration. Since it has a high affinity for CA-II, brinzolamide binds extensively to red blood cells, where CA-II is primarily found. As sufficient CA-II activity remains, adverse effects resulting from the systemic inhibition of CA by brinzolamide are not observed. The metabolite N-desethyl brinzolamide is also formed. This metabolite binds to CA and accumulates in red blood cells as well. In the presence of brinzolamide, the metabolite binds mainly to carbonic anhydrase I (CA-I)."
DB01195,Flecainide,CHEMBL652,"Flecainide acts on sodium channels on the neuronal cell membrane, limiting the spread of seizure activity and reducing seizure propagation. The antiarrhythmic actions are mediated through effects on sodium channels in Purkinje fibers. Flecainide is a sodium channel blocker, binding to voltage gated sodium channels. It stabilizes the neuronal membrane by inhibiting the ionic fluxes required for the initiation and conduction of impulses. Ventricular excitability is depressed and the stimulation threshold of the ventricle is increased during diastole."
DB01196,Estramustine,CHEMBL1575,"Estramustine is a derivative of estradiol with a nitrogen mustard moiety. This gives it alkylating properties. In vivo, the nitrogen mustard component is active and can alklyate DNA and other cellular components (such as tubulin components) of rapidly dividing cells. This causes DNA strandbreaks or misscoding events. This leads to apoptosis and cell death. Also, due to the drugs estrogen component, it can bind more selectively to active estrogen receptors."
DB01197,Captopril,CHEMBL1560,"There are two isoforms of ACE: the somatic isoform, which exists as a glycoprotein comprised of a single polypeptide chain of 1277; and the testicular isoform, which has a lower molecular mass and is thought to play a role in sperm maturation and binding of sperm to the oviduct epithelium. Somatic ACE has two functionally active domains, N and C, which arise from tandem gene duplication. Although the two domains have high sequence similarity, they play distinct physiological roles. The C-domain is predominantly involved in blood pressure regulation while the N-domain plays a role in hematopoietic stem cell differentiation and proliferation. ACE inhibitors bind to and inhibit the activity of both domains, but have much greater affinity for and inhibitory activity against the C-domain. Captopril, one of the few ACE inhibitors that is not a prodrug, competes with ATI for binding to ACE and inhibits and enzymatic proteolysis of ATI to ATII. Decreasing ATII levels in the body decreases blood pressure by inhibiting the pressor effects of ATII as described in the Pharmacology section above. Captopril also causes an increase in plasma renin activity likely due to a loss of feedback inhibition mediated by ATII on the release of renin and/or stimulation of reflex mechanisms via baroreceptors. Captopril’s affinity for ACE is approximately 30,000 times greater than that of ATI."
DB01198,Zopiclone,CHEMBL135400,"Zopiclone exerts its action by binding on the benzodiazepine receptor complex and modulation of the GABA<sub>B</sub>Z receptor chloride channel macromolecular complex. Both zopiclone and benzodiazepines act indiscriminately at the benzodiazepine binding site on α1, α2, α3 and α5 GABAA containing receptors as full agonists causing an enhancement of the inhibitory actions of GABA to produce the therapeutic (hypnotic and anxiolytic) and adverse effects of zopiclone."
DB01199,Tubocurarine,CHEMBL339427,"Tubocurarine, the chief alkaloid in tobacco products, binds stereo-selectively to nicotinic-cholinergic receptors at the autonomic ganglia, in the adrenal medulla, at neuromuscular junctions, and in the brain. Two types of central nervous system effects are believed to be the basis of Tubocurarine's positively reinforcing properties. A stimulating effect is exerted mainly in the cortex via the locus ceruleus and a reward effect is exerted in the limbic system. At low doses the stimulant effects predominate while at high doses the reward effects predominate. Intermittent intravenous administration of Tubocurarine activates neurohormonal pathways, releasing acetylcholine, norepinephrine, dopamine, serotonin, vasopressin, beta-endorphin, growth hormone, and ACTH."
DB01200,Bromocriptine,CHEMBL493,"The dopamine D<sub>2</sub> receptor is a 7-transmembrane G-protein coupled receptor associated with G<sub>i</sub> proteins. In lactotrophs, stimulation of dopamine D<sub>2</sub> receptor causes inhibition of adenylyl cyclase, which decreases intracellular cAMP concentrations and blocks IP3-dependent release of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from intracellular stores. Decreases in intracellular calcium levels may also be brought about via inhibition of calcium influx through voltage-gated calcium channels, rather than via inhibition of adenylyl cyclase. Additionally, receptor activation blocks phosphorylation of p42/p44 MAPK and decreases MAPK/ERK kinase phosphorylation. Inhibition of MAPK appears to be mediated by c-Raf and B-Raf-dependent inhibition of MAPK/ERK kinase. Dopamine-stimulated growth hormone release from the pituitary gland is mediated by a decrease in intracellular calcium influx through voltage-gated calcium channels rather than via adenylyl cyclase inhibition. Stimulation of dopamine D<sub>2</sub> receptors in the nigrostriatal pathway leads to improvements in coordinated muscle activity in those with movement disorders. "
DB01201,Rifapentine,CHEMBL1660,"Rifapentine has shown higher bacteriostatic and bactericidal activities especially against intracellular bacteria growing in human monocyte-derived macrophages. Rifapentine inhibits DNA-dependent RNA polymerase in susceptible strains of M. tuberculosis. Rifapentine acts via the inhibition of DNA-dependent RNA polymerase, leading to a suppression of RNA synthesis and cell death."
DB01202,Levetiracetam,CHEMBL1286,"The precise mechanism(s) by which levetiracetam exerts its antiepileptic effect is unknown. The antiepileptic activity of levetiracetam was assessed in a number of animal models of epileptic seizures. Levetiracetam did not inhibit single seizures induced by maximal stimulation with electrical current or different chemoconvulsants and showed only minimal activity in submaximal stimulation and in threshold tests. Protection was observed, however, against secondarily generalized activity from focal seizures induced by pilocarpine and kainic acid, two chemoconvulsants that induce seizures that mimic some features of human complex partial seizures with secondary generalization. Levetiracetam also displayed inhibitory properties in the kindling model in rats, another model of human complex partial seizures, both during kindling development and in the fully kindled state. The predictive value of these animal models for specific types of human epilepsy is uncertain. Levetiracetam is thought to stimulate synaptic vesicle protein 2A (SV2A), inhibiting neurotransmitter release."
DB01203,Nadolol,CHEMBL649,"Like other beta-adrenergic antagonists, nadolol competes with adrenergic neurotransmitters such as catecholamines for binding at sympathetic receptor sites. Like propranolol and timolol, nadolol binds at beta(1)-adrenergic receptors in the heart and vascular smooth muscle, inhibiting the effects of the catecholamines epinephrine and norepinephrine and decreasing heart rate, cardiac output, and systolic and diastolic blood pressure. It also blocks beta-2 adrenergic receptors located in bronchiole smooth muscle, causing vasoconstriction. By binding beta-2 receptors in the juxtaglomerular apparatus, nadolol inhibits the production of renin, thereby inhibiting angiotensin II and aldosterone production. Nadolol therefore inhibits the vasoconstriction and water retention due to angiotensin II and aldosterone, respectively."
DB01204,Mitoxantrone,CHEMBL58,"Mitoxantrone, a DNA-reactive agent that intercalates into deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) through hydrogen bonding, causes crosslinks and strand breaks. Mitoxantrone also interferes with ribonucleic acid (RNA) and is a potent inhibitor of topoisomerase II, an enzyme responsible for uncoiling and repairing damaged DNA. It has a cytocidal effect on both proliferating and nonproliferating cultured human cells, suggesting lack of cell cycle phase specificity."
DB01205,Flumazenil,CHEMBL407,"Flumazenil, an imidazobenzodiazepine derivative, antagonizes the actions of benzodiazepines on the central nervous system. Flumazenil competitively inhibits the activity at the benzodiazepine recognition site on the GABA/benzodiazepine receptor complex. Flumazenil is a weak partial agonist in some animal models of activity, but has little or no agonist activity in man."
DB01206,Lomustine,CHEMBL514,"Lomustine is a highly lipophilic nitrosourea compound which undergoes hydrolysis in vivo to form reactive metabolites. These metabolites cause alkylation and cross-linking of DNA (at the O6 position of guanine-containing bases) and RNA, thus inducing cytotoxicity. Other biologic effects include inhibition of DNA synthesis and some cell cycle phase specificity. Nitrosureas generally lack cross-resistance with other alkylating agents. As lomustine is a nitrosurea, it may also inhibit several key processes such as carbamoylation and modification of cellular proteins."
DB01207,Ridogrel,CHEMBL280728,"Ridogrel inhibits thromboxane A2 synthase and also blocks the thromboxane A2/prostaglandin endoperoxide receptors.
Thromboxane synthetase produces thromboxane in platelets. Thromboxane is a vasoconstrictor and facilitates the clumping of platelets. Therefore by inhibiting the production and promotion of thromboxane, thrombolysis is enhanced."
DB01208,Sparfloxacin,CHEMBL850,"The bactericidal action of sparfloxacin results from inhibition of the enzymes topoisomerase II (DNA gyrase) and topoisomerase IV, which are required for bacterial DNA replication, transcription, repair, and recombination."
DB01209,Dezocine,CHEMBL1685,"Dezocine is a opioid analgesic drug of mixed agonist-antagonist type. It binds with stereospecific receptors at many sites within the central nervous system (CNS) to alter processes affecting both the perception of pain and the emotional response to pain. At least 2 of these types of receptors (mu and kappa) mediate analgesia. Mu receptors are widely distributed throughout the CNS, especially in the limbic system (frontal cortex, temporal cortex, amygdala, and hippocampus), thalamus, striatum, hypothalamus, and midbrain as well as laminae I, II, IV, and V of the dorsal horn in the spinal cord. Kappa receptors are localized primarily in the spinal cord and in the cerebral cortex."
DB01210,Levobunolol,CHEMBL1201237,"Levobunolol's mechanism of action in reducing IOP is not clearly defined, but is believed to be due to a reduction of the production of aqueous humor via blockage of endogenous catecholamine-stimulated increases in cyclic adenosine monophosphate (AMP) concentrations within the ciliary processes."
DB01211,Clarithromycin,CHEMBL1741,"Clarithromycin is first metabolized to 14-OH clarithromycin, which is active and works synergistically with its parent compound. Like other macrolides, it then penetrates bacteria cell wall and reversibly binds to domain V of the 23S ribosomal RNA of the 50S subunit of the bacterial ribosome, blocking translocation of aminoacyl transfer-RNA and polypeptide synthesis. Clarithromycin also inhibits the hepatic microsomal CYP3A4 isoenzyme and P-glycoprotein, an energy-dependent drug efflux pump."
DB01212,Ceftriaxone,CHEMBL161,"Ceftriaxone works by inhibiting the mucopeptide synthesis in the bacterial cell wall. The beta-lactam moiety of Ceftriaxone binds to carboxypeptidases, endopeptidases, and transpeptidases in the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane. These enzymes are involved in cell-wall synthesis and cell division. By binding to these enzymes, Ceftriaxone results in the formation of of defective cell walls and cell death."
DB01213,Fomepizole,CHEMBL1308,Antizol (fomepizole) is a competitive inhibitor of alcohol dehydrogenase. Alcohol dehydrogenase catalyzes the oxidation of ethanol to acetaldehyde. Alcohol dehydrogenase also catalyzes the initial steps in the metabolism of ethylene glycol and methanol to their toxic metabolites.
DB01214,Metipranolol,CHEMBL1291,"Although it is known that metipranolol binds the beta1 and beta2 adrenergic receptors, the mechanism of metipranolol's action is not known. It has no significant intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, and has only weak local anesthetic (membrane-stabilizing) and myocardial depressant activity. It appears that the ophthalmic beta-adrenergic blocking agents reduce aqueous humor production, as demonstrated by tonography and fluorophotometry. A slight increase in aqueous humor outflow may be an additional mechanism."
DB01215,Estazolam,CHEMBL285674,"Benzodiazepines bind nonspecifically to benzodiazepine receptors, which affects affects muscle relaxation, anticonvulsant activity, motor coordination, and memory. As benzodiazepine receptors are thought to be coupled to gamma-aminobutyric acid-A (GABA<sub>A</sub>) receptors, this enhances the effects GABA by increasing GABA affinity for the GABA receptor. Binding of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA to the site opens the chloride channel, resulting in a hyperpolarized cell membrane that prevents further excitation of the cell."
DB01216,Finasteride,CHEMBL710,"The mechanism of action of Finasteride is based on its preferential inhibition of Type II 5a-reductase through the formation of a stable complex with the enzyme. Inhibition of Type II 5a-reductase blocks the peripheral conversion of testosterone to DHT, resulting in significant decreases in serum and tissue DHT concentrations, minimal to moderate increase in serum testosterone concentrations, and substantial increases in prostatic testosterone concetrations. As DHT appears to be the principal androgen responsible for stimulation of prostatic growth, a decrease in DHT concentrations will result in a decrease in prostatic volume (approximately 20-30% after 6-24 months of continued therapy). In men with androgenic alopecia, the mechanism of action has not been fully determined, but finasteride has shown to decrease scalp DHT concentration to the levels found in hairy scalp, reduce serum DHT, increase hair regrowth, and slow hair loss."
DB01217,Anastrozole,CHEMBL1399,"Anastrozole selectively inhibits aromatase. The principal source of circulating estrogen (primarily estradiol) is conversion of adrenally-generated androstenedione to estrone by aromatase in peripheral tissues. Therefore, aromatase inhibition leads to a decrease in serum and tumor concentration of estrogen, leading to a decreased tumor mass or delayed progression of tumor growth in some women. Anastrozole has no detectable effect on synthesis of adrenal corticosteroids, aldosterone, and thyroid hormone."
DB01218,Halofantrine,CHEMBL1107,"The mechanism of action of Halofantrine may be similar to that of chloroquine, quinine, and mefloquine; by forming toxic complexes with ferritoporphyrin IX that damage the membrane of the parasite."
DB01219,Dantrolene,CHEMBL1201288,"Dantrolene depresses excitation-contraction coupling in skeletal muscle by binding to the ryanodine receptor 1, and decreasing intracellular calcium concentration. Ryanodine receptors mediate the release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, an essential step in muscle contraction."
DB01220,Rifaximin,CHEMBL1617,"Rifaximin acts by inhibiting RNA synthesis in susceptible bacteria by binding to the beta-subunit of bacterial deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)-dependent ribonucleic acid (RNA) polymerase enzyme. This results in the blockage of the translocation step that normally follows the formation of the first phosphodiester bond, which occurs in the transcription process."
DB01221,Ketamine,CHEMBL742,"Ketamine has several clinically useful properties, including analgesia and less cardiorespiratory depressant effects than other anaesthetic agents, it also causes some stimulation of the cardiocascular system. Ketamine has been reported to produce general as well as local anaesthesia. It interacts with N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, opioid receptors, monoaminergic receptors, muscarinic receptors and voltage sensitive Ca ion channels. Unlike other general anaesthetic agents, ketamine does not interact with GABA receptors."
DB01222,Budesonide,CHEMBL1370,"Budesonide is an anti-inflammatory corticosteroid that exhibits potent glucocorticoid activity and weak mineralocorticoid activity. The precise mechanism of corticosteroid actions on inflammation in asthma, Crohn's disease, or ulcerative colitis is not known. Inflammation is an important component in the pathogenesis of asthma. Corticosteroids have been shown to have a wide range of inhibitory activities against multiple cell types (eg, mast cells, eosinophils, neutrophils, macrophages, and lymphocytes) and mediators (eg, histamine, eicosanoids, leukotrienes, and cytokines) involved in allergic and non-allergic-mediated inflammation. These anti-inflammatory actions of corticosteroids may contribute to their efficacy in the aforementioned diseases. Because budesonide undergoes significant first-pass elimination, the both oral preparations are formulated as an extended release tablet. As a result, budesonide release is delyaed until exposure to a pH ≥ 7 in the small intestine. "
DB01223,Aminophylline,CHEMBL1370561,"Aminophylline is the ethylenediamine salt of theophylline. After ingestion, theophylline is released from aminophylline, and theophylline relaxes the smooth muscle of the bronchial airways and pulmonary blood vessels and reduces airway responsiveness to histamine, methacholine, adenosine, and allergen. Theophylline competitively inhibits type III and type IV phosphodiesterase (PDE), the enzyme responsible for breaking down cyclic AMP in smooth muscle cells, possibly resulting in bronchodilation. Theophylline also binds to the adenosine A2B receptor and blocks adenosine mediated bronchoconstriction. In inflammatory states, theophylline activates histone deacetylase to prevent transcription of inflammatory genes that require the acetylation of histones for transcription to begin."
DB01224,Quetiapine,CHEMBL716,Quetiapine's antipsychotic activity is likely due to a combination of antagonism at D2 receptors in the mesolimbic pathway and 5HT2A receptors in the frontal cortex. Antagonism at D2 receptors relieves positive symptoms while antagonism at 5HT2A receptors relieves negative symptoms of schizophrenia.
DB01225,Enoxaparin,CHEMBL1201685,"The mechanism of action of enoxaparin is antithrombin-dependent. It acts mainly by accelerating the rate of the neutralization of certain activated coagulation factors by antithrombin, but other mechanisms may also be involved. The antithrombotic effect of enoxaparin is well correlated to the inhibition of factor Xa. Enoxaparin interacts with Antithrombin III, Prothrombin and Factor X. Enoxaparin binds to and accelerates the activity of antithrombin III. By activating antithrombin III, enoxaparin preferentially potentiates the inhibition of coagulation factors Xa and IIa."
DB01226,Mivacurium,CHEMBL1182833,"Mivacurium binds competitively to cholinergic receptors on the motor end-plate to antagonize the action of acetylcholine, resulting in a block of neuromuscular transmission. This action is antagonized by acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, such as neostigmine."
DB01227,Levomethadyl Acetate,CHEMBL1514,"Opiate receptors (Mu, Kappa, Delta) are coupled with G-protein receptors and function as both positive and negative regulators of synaptic transmission via G-proteins that activate effector proteins. Binding of the opiate stimulates the exchange of GTP for GDP on the G-protein complex. As the effector system is adenylate cyclase and cAMP located at the inner surface of the plasma membrane, opioids decrease intracellular cAMP by inhibiting adenylate cyclase. Subsequently, the release of nociceptive neurotransmitters such as substance P, GABA, dopamine, acetylcholine and noradrenaline is inhibited. Opioids also inhibit the release of vasopressin, somatostatin, insulin and glucagon. Levomethadyl acetate effectively opens calcium-dependent inwardly rectifying potassium channels (OP1 receptor agonist), resulting in hyperpolarization and reduced neuronal excitability."
DB01228,Encainide,CHEMBL315838,"Encainide is a sodium channel blocker, binding to voltage gated sodium channels.

Ventricular excitability is depressed and the stimulation threshold of the ventricle is increased during diastole."
DB01229,Paclitaxel,CHEMBL428647,"Paclitaxel interferes with the normal function of microtubule growth. Whereas drugs like colchicine cause the depolymerization of microtubules in vivo, paclitaxel arrests their function by having the opposite effect; it hyper-stabilizes their structure. This destroys the cell's ability to use its cytoskeleton in a flexible manner. Specifically, paclitaxel binds to the &beta; subunit of tubulin. Tubulin is the ""building block"" of mictotubules, and the binding of paclitaxel locks these building blocks in place. The resulting microtubule/paclitaxel complex does not have the ability to disassemble. This adversely affects cell function because the shortening and lengthening of microtubules (termed dynamic instability) is necessary for their function as a transportation highway for the cell. Chromosomes, for example, rely upon this property of microtubules during mitosis. Further research has indicated that paclitaxel induces programmed cell death (apoptosis) in cancer cells by binding to an apoptosis stopping protein called Bcl-2 (B-cell leukemia 2) and thus arresting its function."
DB01230,Pemoline,CHEMBL1177,
DB01231,Diphenidol,CHEMBL936,"The mechanism by which diphenidol exerts its antiemetic and antivertigo effects is not precisely known. It is thought to diminish vestibular stimulation and depress labyrinthine function and as an antimuscarinic agent. An action on the medullary chemoreceptive trigger zone may also be involved in the antiemetic effect. Diphenidol has no significant sedative, tranquilizing, or antihistaminic action. It has a weak peripheral anticholinergic effect."
DB01232,Saquinavir,CHEMBL114,"Saquinavir inhibits the HIV viral proteinase enzyme which prevents cleavage of the gag-pol polyprotein, resulting in noninfectious, immature viral particles."
DB01233,Metoclopramide,CHEMBL86,"Metoclopramide inhibits gastric smooth muscle relaxation produced by dopamine, therefore increasing cholinergic response of the gastrointestinal smooth muscle. It accelerates intestinal transit and gastric emptying by preventing relaxation of gastric body and increasing the phasic activity of antrum. Simultaneously, this action is accompanied by relaxation of the upper small intestine, resulting in an improved coordination between the body and antrum of the stomach and the upper small intestine. Metoclopramide also decreases reflux into the esophagus by increasing the resting pressure of the lower esophageal sphincter and improves acid clearance from the esophagus by increasing amplitude of esophageal peristaltic contractions. Metoclopramide's dopamine antagonist action raises the threshold of activity in the chemoreceptor trigger zone and decreases the input from afferent visceral nerves. Studies have also shown that high doses of metoclopramide can antagonize 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) receptors in the peripheral nervous system in animals."
DB01234,Dexamethasone,CHEMBL384467,"Dexamethasone is a glucocorticoid agonist. Unbound dexamethasone crosses cell membranes and binds with high affinity to specific cytoplasmic glucocorticoid receptors. This complex binds to DNA elements (glucocorticoid response elements) which results in a modification of transcription and, hence, protein synthesis in order to achieve inhibition of leukocyte infiltration at the site of inflammation, interference in the function of mediators of inflammatory response, suppression of humoral immune responses, and reduction in edema or scar tissue. The antiinflammatory actions of dexamethasone are thought to involve phospholipase A<sub>2</sub> inhibitory proteins, lipocortins, which control the biosynthesis of potent mediators of inflammation such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes."
DB01235,Levodopa,CHEMBL1009,"Striatal dopamine levels in symptomatic Parkinson's disease are decreased by 60 to 80%, striatal dopaminergic neurotransmission may be enhanced by exogenous supplementation of dopamine through administration of dopamine's precursor, levodopa. A small percentage of each levodopa dose crosses the blood-brain barrier and is decarboxylated to dopamine. This newly formed dopamine then is available to stimulate dopaminergic receptors, thus compensating for the depleted supply of endogenous dopamine."
DB01236,Sevoflurane,CHEMBL1200694,"Sevoflurane induces a reduction in junctional conductance by decreasing gap junction channel opening times and increasing gap junction channel closing times. Sevoflurane also activates calcium dependent ATPase in the sarcoplasmic reticulum by increasing the fluidity of the lipid membrane. It also appears to bind the D subunit of ATP synthase and NADH dehydogenase and also binds to the GABA receptor, the large conductance Ca<sup>2+</sup> activated potassium channel, the glutamate receptor, and the glycine receptor."
DB01237,Bromodiphenhydramine,CHEMBL1201245,"Bromodiphenhydramine competes with free histamine for binding at HA-receptor sites. This antagonizes the effects of histamine on HA-receptors, leading to a reduction of the negative symptoms brought on by histamine HA-receptor binding."

DB01240,Epoprostenol,CHEMBL1139,"Prostaglandins are present in most body tissues and fluids and mediate many biological functions. Epoprostenol (PGI2) is a member of the family of prostaglandins that is derived from arachidonic acid. The major pharmacological actions of epoprostenol is ultimately inhibition of platelet aggregation. Prostacyclin (PGI2) is released by healthy endothelial cells and performs its function through a paracrine signaling cascade that involves G protein-coupled receptors on nearby platelets and endothelial cells. The platelet Gs protein-coupled receptor (prostacyclin receptor) is activated when it binds to PGI2. This activation, in turn, signals adenylyl cyclase to produce cAMP. cAMP goes on to inhibit any undue platelet activation (in order to promote circulation) and also counteracts any increase in cytosolic calcium levels which would result from thromboxane A2 (TXA2) binding (leading to platelet activation and subsequent coagulation). PGI2 also binds to endothelial prostacyclin receptors and in the same manner raise cAMP levels in the cytosol. This cAMP then goes on to activate protein kinase A (PKA). PKA then continues the cascade by phosphorylating and inhibiting myosin light-chain kinase which leads to smooth muscle relaxation and vasodilation. Notably, PGI2 and TXA2 work as physiological antagonists."
DB01241,Gemfibrozil,CHEMBL457,"Gemfibrozil increases the activity of extrahepatic lipoprotein lipase (LL), thereby increasing lipoprotein triglyceride lipolysis. It does so by activating Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPARα) 'transcription factor ligand', a receptor that is involved in metabolism of carbohydrates and fats, as well as adipose tissue differentiation. This increase in the synthesis of lipoprotein lipase thereby increases the clearance of triglycerides. Chylomicrons are degraded, VLDLs are converted to LDLs, and LDLs are converted to HDL. This is accompanied by a slight increase in secretion of lipids into the bile and ultimately the intestine. Gemfibrozil also inhibits the synthesis and increases the clearance of apolipoprotein B, a carrier molecule for VLDL."
DB01242,Clomipramine,CHEMBL415,"Clomipramine is a strong, but not completely selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SRI), as the active main metabolite desmethyclomipramine acts preferably as an inhibitor of noradrenaline reuptake. &alpha;<sub>1</sub>-receptor blockage and &beta;-down-regulation have been noted and most likely play a role in the short term effects of clomipramine. A blockade of sodium-channels and NDMA-receptors might, as with other tricyclics, account for its effect in chronic pain, in particular the neuropathic type."
DB01243,Chloroxine,CHEMBL1200596,"Although the mechanism of action is not understood, chloroxine may slow down mitotic activity in the epidermis, thereby reducing excessive scaling associated with dandruff or seborrheic dermatitis of the scalp. Chloroxine induces SOS-DNA repair in E. coli, so chloroxine may be genotoxic to bacteria."
DB01244,Bepridil,CHEMBL1008,"Bepridil has inhibitory effects on both the slow calcium (L-type) and fast sodium inward currents in myocardial and vascular smooth muscle, interferes with calcium binding to calmodulin, and blocks both voltage and receptor operated calcium channels. Bepridil inhibits the transmembrane influx of calcium ions into cardiac and vascular smooth muscle. This has been demonstrated in isolated myocardial and vascular smooth muscle preparations in which both the slope of the calcium dose response curve and the maximum calcium-induced inotropic response were significantly reduced by bepridil. In cardiac myocytes <i>in vitro</i>, bepridil was shown to be tightly bound to actin. Bepridil regularly reduces heart rate and arterial pressure at rest and at a given level of exercise by dilating peripheral arterioles and reducing total peripheral resistance (afterload) against which the heart works."

MAO subtypes A and B are involved in the metabolism of serotonin and catecholamine neurotransmitters such as epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine. Isocarboxazid, as a nonselective MAO inhibitor, binds irreversibly to monoamine oxidase&ndash;A (MAO-A) and monoamine oxidase&ndash;B (MAO-B). The reduced MAO activity results in an increased concentration of these neurotransmitters in storage sites throughout the central nervous system (CNS) and sympathetic nervous system. This increased availability of one or more monoamines is the basis for the antidepressant activity of MAO inhibitors."

This adversely affects cell function because the shortening and lengthening of microtubules (termed dynamic instability) is necessary for their function as a transportation highway for the cell. Chromosomes, for example, rely upon this property of microtubules during mitosis. Further research has indicated that docetaxel induces programmed cell death (apoptosis) in cancer cells by binding to an apoptosis stopping protein called Bcl-2 (B-cell leukemia 2) and thus arresting its function."
DB01249,Iodixanol,CHEMBL1200507,"Organic iodine compounds attenuate x-rays as they pass through the body, thereby allowing the body structures containing iodine to be delineated in contrast to those structures that do not contain iodine. The degree of opacity produced by these compounds is directly proportional to the total amount (concentration and volume) of the iodinated contrast agent in the path of the x-rays. After intravascular administration, iodixanol makes opaque those internal structures in its path of flow, allowing their visualization until significant hemodilution and elimination occur."
DB01250,Olsalazine,CHEMBL425,"Orally administered olsalazine is converted to mesalamine which is thought to be the therapeutically active agent in the treatment of ulcerative colitis. The mechanism of action of mesalamine (and sulfasalazine) is unknown, but appears to be topical rather than systemic. Mucosal production of arachidonic acid (AA) metabolites, both through the cyclooxygenase pathways, i.e., prostanoids, and through the lipoxygenase pathways, i.e., leukotrienes (LTs) and hydroxyelcosatetraenoic acids (HETEs) is increased in patients with chronic inflammatory bowel disease, and it is possible that mesalamine diminishes inflammation by blocking cyclooxygenase and inhibiting prostaglandin (PG) production in the colon."
DB01251,Gliquidone,CHEMBL383634,"The mechanism of action of gliquidone in lowering blood glucose appears to be dependent on stimulating the release of insulin from functioning pancreatic beta cells, and increasing sensitivity of peripheral tissues to insulin. Gliquidone likely binds to ATP-sensitive potassium channel receptors on the pancreatic cell surface, reducing potassium conductance and causing depolarization of the membrane. Membrane depolarization stimulates calcium ion influx through voltage-sensitive calcium channels. This increase in intracellular calcium ion concentration induces the secretion of insulin."
DB01252,Mitiglinide,CHEMBL471498,"Mitiglinide is thought to stimulate insulin secretion by binding to and blocking ATP-sensitive K(+) (K(ATP)) channels (Kir6.2/SUR1 complex, KATP channels) in pancreatic beta-cells. Closure of potassium channels causes depolarization which stimulates calcium influx through voltage-gated calcium channels. High intracellular calcium subsequently triggers the exocytosis of insulin granules. "
DB01253,Ergonovine,CHEMBL119443,"Ergonovine directly stimulates the uterine muscle to increase force and frequency of contractions. With usual doses, these contractions precede periods of relaxation; with larger doses, basal uterine tone is elevated and these relaxation periods will be decreased. Contraction of the uterine wall around bleeding vessels at the placental site produces hemostasis. Ergonovine also induces cervical contractions. The sensitivity of the uterus to the oxytocic effect is much greater toward the end of pregnancy. The oxytocic actions of ergonovine are greater than its vascular effects. Ergonovine, like other ergot alkaloids, produces arterial vasoconstriction by stimulation of alpha-adrenergic and serotonin receptors and inhibition of endothelial-derived relaxation factor release. It is a less potent vasoconstrictor than ergotamine. As a diagnostic aid (coronary vasospasm), ergonovine causes vasoconstriction of coronary arteries."
DB01254,Dasatinib,CHEMBL1421,"Dasatinib, at nanomolar concentrations, inhibits the following kinases: BCR-ABL, SRC family (SRC, LCK, YES, FYN), c-KIT, EPHA2, and PDGFR&beta;. Based on modeling studies, dasatinib is predicted to bind to multiple conformations of the ABL kinase. In vitro, dasatinib was active in leukemic cell lines representing variants of imatinib mesylate sensitive and resistant disease. Dasatinib inhibited the growth of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cell lines overexpressing BCR-ABL. Under the conditions of the assays, dasatinib was able to overcome imatinib resistance resulting from BCR-ABL kinase domain mutations, activation of alternate signaling pathways involving the SRC family kinases (LYN, HCK), and multi-drug resistance gene overexpression. "
DB01255,Lisdexamfetamine,CHEMBL1201222,"Lisdexamfetamine is a pro-drug of dextroamphetamine. Amphetamines are thought to block the reuptake of norepinephrine and dopamine into the presynaptic neuron and increase the release of these monoamines into the extraneuronal space. Norepinephrine and dopamine contribute to maintaining alertness, increasing focus, and sustaining thought, effort, and motivation. However, the exact therapeutic action in ADHD is not known.
"
DB01256,Retapamulin,CHEMBL566434,"Retapamulin is a bacterial protein synthesis inhibitor belonging to a class of compounds called pleuromutilins. These compounds inhibit the initiation of protein synthesis by binding to a specific site on the 50S subunit of bacterial ribosome (domain V of 23S rRNA). This binding site involves ribosomal protein L3 and is in the region of the ribosomal P site and peptidyl transferase center. By virtue of binding to this site, pleuromutilins inhibit peptidyl transfer, block P-site interactions, and prevent the normal formation of active 50S ribosomal subunits."
DB01257,Eculizumab,CHEMBL1201828,"A genetic mutation in PNH patients leads to the generation of populations of abnormal RBCs (known as PNH cells) that are deficient in terminal complement inhibitors (CD-59), rendering PNH RBCs sensitive to persistent terminal complement-mediated destruction. The destruction and loss of these PNH cells (intravascular hemolysis) results in low RBC counts (anemia) and also fatigue, difficulty in functioning, pain, dark urine, shortness of breath, and blood clots. Eculizumab, the active ingredient in Soliris, is a monoclonal antibody that binds to the complement protein C5 specifically and with high affinity, thereby inhibiting its cleavage to C5a and C5b and subsequent generation of the terminal complement complex C5b-9. Soliris inhibits terminal complement mediated intravascular hemolysis in PNH patients and therefore the destruction of PNH erythrocytes that lack complement protection with CD-59. "
DB01259,Lapatinib,CHEMBL554,Lapatinib is a 4-anilinoquinazoline kinase inhibitor of the intracellular tyrosine kinase domains of both epidermal growth factor receptor (HER1/EGFR/ERBB1) and human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 (HER2/ERBB2)with a dissociation half-life of &ge;300 minutes. Lapatinib inhibits ERBB-driven tumor cell growth in vitro and in various animal models. An additive effect was demonstrated in an in vitro study when lapatinib and 5-florouracil (the active metabolite of capecitabine) were used in combination in the 4 tumor cell lines tested. The growth inhibitory effects of lapatinib were evaluated in trastuzumab-conditioned cell lines. Lapatinib retained significant activity against breast cancer cell lines selected for long-term growth in trastuzumab-containing medium in vitro. These in vitro findings suggest non-cross-resistance between these two agents.
DB01260,Desonide,CHEMBL1201109,"Like other topical corticosteroids, desonide has anti-inflammatory, antipruritic and vasoconstrictive properties. The drug binds to cytosolic glucocorticoid receptors. This complex migrates to the nucleus and binds to genetic elements on the DNA. This activates and represses various genes. However corticosteroids are thought to act by the induction of phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins, collectively called lipocortins. It is postulated that these proteins control the biosynthesis of potent mediators of inflammation such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes by inhibiting the release of their common precursor arachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid is released from membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A2."
DB01261,Sitagliptin,CHEMBL1422,"Sitagliptin is a highly selective DPP-4 inhibitor, which is believed to exert its actions in patients with type 2 diabetes by slowing the inactivation of incretin hormones, thereby increasing the concentration and prolonging the action of these hormones. Incretin hormones, including glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), are released by the intestine throughout the day, and levels are increased in response to a meal. These hormones are rapidly inactivated by the enzyme, DPP-4. The incretins are part of an endogenous system involved in the physiologic regulation of glucose homeostasis. When blood glucose concentrations are normal or elevated, GLP-1 and GIP increase insulin synthesis and release from pancreatic beta cells by intracellular signaling pathways involving cyclic AMP. GLP-1 also lowers glucagon secretion from pancreatic alpha cells, leading to reduced hepatic glucose production. By increasing and prolonging active incretin levels, sitagliptin increases insulin release and decreases glucagon levels in the circulation in a glucose-dependent manner. These changes lead to a decrease in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c)levels, as well as a lower fasting and postprandial glucose concentration. Sitagliptin demonstrates selectivity for DPP-4 and does not inhibit DPP-8 or DPP-9 activity in vitro at concentrations approximating those from therapeutic doses."
DB01262,Decitabine,CHEMBL1201129,"Decitabine is believed to exert its antineoplastic effects following its conversion to decitabine triphosphate, where the drug directly incorporates into DNA and inhibits DNA methyltransferase, the enzyme that is responsible for methylating newly synthesized DNA in mammalian cells. This results in hypomethylation of DNA and cellular differentiation or apoptosis. Decitabine inhibits DNA methylation in vitro, which is achieved at concentrations that do not cause major suppression of DNA synthesis. Decitabine-induced hypomethylation in neoplastic cells may restore normal function to genes that are critical for the control of cellular differentiation and proliferation. In rapidly dividing cells, the cytotoxicity of decitabine may also be attributed to the formation of covalent adducts between DNA methyltransferase and decitabine that has been incorporated into DNA. Non-proliferating cells are relatively insensitive to decitabine. Decitabine is cell cycle specific and acts peripherally in the S phase of the cell cycle. It does not inhibit the progression of cells from the G1 to S phase."
DB01263,Posaconazole,CHEMBL1397,"As a triazole antifungal agent, posaconazole exerts its antifungal activity through blockage of the cytochrome P-450 dependent enzyme, sterol 14&alpha;-demethylase, in fungi by binding to the heme cofactor located on the enzyme. This leads to the inhibition of the synthesis of ergosterol, a key component of the fungal cell membrane, and accumulation of methylated sterol precursors. This results in inhibition of fungal cell growth and ultimately, cell death."
DB01264,Darunavir,CHEMBL1323,"Darunavir is a HIV protease inhibitor which prevents HIV replication by binding to the enzyme's active site, thereby preventing the dimerization and the catalytic activity of the HIV-1 protease. Darunavir selectively inhibits the cleavage of HIV encoded Gag-Pol polyproteins in virus-infected cells, which prevents the formation of mature infectious virus particles. Structual analyses suggests that the close contact that darunavir has with the main chains of the protease active site amino acids (Asp-29 and Asp-30) is an important contributing factor to its potency and wide spectrum of activity against multi-protease inhibitor resistant HIV-1 variants. Darunavir can also adapt to the changing shape of a protease enzyme because of its molecular flexibility. Darunavir is known to bind to two distinct sites on the enzyme: the active site cavity and the surface of one of the flexible flaps in the protease dimer."
DB01265,Telbivudine,CHEMBL374731,"Telbivudine 5'–triphosphate inhibits HBV DNA polymerase (reverse transcriptase) by competing with the natural substrate, thymidine 5'–triphosphate. This leads to the chain termination of DNA synthesis, thereby inhibiting viral replication. Incorporation of telbivudine 5'–triphosphate into viral DNA also causes DNA chain termination, resulting in inhibition of HBV replication. Telbivudine inhibits anticompliment or second-strand DNA."
DB01266,Sinecatechins,,"While the exact mechanism of action of catechins is unknown, they are powerful anti-oxidants and are linked to to evidence of fighting tumors as well as enhancing immune system function."
DB01267,Paliperidone,CHEMBL1621,"Paliperidone is the major active metabolite of risperidone. The mechanism of action of paliperidone, as with other drugs having efficacy in schizophrenia, is unknown, but it has been proposed that the drug's therapeutic activity in schizophrenia is mediated through a combination of central dopamine Type 2 (D2) and serotonin Type 2 (5HT2A) receptor antagonism."
DB01268,Sunitinib,CHEMBL535,"Sunitinib is a small molecule that inhibits multiple RTKs, some of which are implicated in tumor growth, pathologic angiogenesis, and metastatic progression of cancer. Sunitinib was evaluated for its inhibitory activity against a variety of kinases (>80 kinases) and was identified as an inhibitor of platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGFRa and PDGFRb), vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR1, VEGFR2 and VEGFR3), stem cell factor receptor (KIT), Fms-like tyrosine kinase-3 (FLT3), colony stimulating factor receptor Type 1 (CSF-1R), and the glial cell-line derived neurotrophic factor receptor (RET). Sunitinib inhibition of the activity of these RTKs has been demonstrated in biochemical and cellular assays, and inhibition of function has been demonstrated in cell proliferation assays. The primary metabolite exhibits similar potency compared to sunitinib in biochemical and cellular assays."
DB01269,Panitumumab,CHEMBL1201827,"Panitumumab binds specifically to EGFR on both normal and tumor cells, and competitively inhibits the binding of ligands for EGFR. Nonclinical studies show that binding of panitumumab to the EGFR prevents ligand-induced receptor autophosphorylation and activation of receptor-associated kinases, resulting in inhibition of cell growth, induction of apoptosis, decreased pro-inflammatory cytokine and vascular growth factor production, and internalization of the EGFR."
DB01270,Ranibizumab,CHEMBL1201825,"Ranibizumab binds to the receptor binding site of active forms of VEGF-A, including the biologically active, cleaved form of this molecule, VEGF<sub>110</sub>. The binding of ranibizumab to VEGF-A prevents the interaction of VEGF-A with its receptors (VEGFR1 and VEGFR2) on the surface of endothelial cells, reducing endothelial cell proliferation, vascular leakage, and new blood vessel formation."
DB01271,Idursulfase,CHEMBL1201826,"Hunter's Syndrome is an X-linked recessive disease caused by insufficient levels of the lysosomal enzyme iduronate-2-sulfatase. This enzyme cleaves the terminal 2-O-sulfate moieties from the glycosaminoglycans (GAG) dermatan sulfate and heparan sulfate. Due to the missing or defective iduronate-2-sulfatase enzyme in patients with Hunter's Syndrome, GAG progressively accumulate in the lysosomes of a variety of cells, leading to cellular engorgement, organomegaly, tissue destruction and organ system dysfunction. Treatment of Hunter's Syndrome patients with idursulfase provides exogenous enzyme for uptake into cellular lysosomes. Targeting of idursulfase to the lysosome occurs by endocytosis from the cell surface. Mannose-6-phosphate (M6P) residues on the oligosaccharide chains allow specific binding of the enzymes to the M6P receptors on the cell surface, leading to cellular internalization of the enzyme, targeting to intracellular lysosomes and subsequent catabolism of accumulated GAG."
DB01272,Alglucosidase alfa,CHEMBL1201824,"Alglucosidase alfa is designed to act as an exogenous source of GAA, acting to correct GAA deficiency that is the hallmark of Pompe disease. Alglucosidase alfa binds to mannose-6-phosphate receptors on the cell surface via carbohydrate groups on the GAA molecule, after which it is internalized and transported into lysosomes, where it undergoes proteolytic cleavage that results in increased enzymatic activity. It then exerts enzymatic activity in cleaving glycogen. Specifically, it hydrolyses alpha-1,4-glucose bonds.

DB01273,Varenicline,CHEMBL1396,"Varenicline is an alpha-4 beta-2 neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor partial agonist. The drug shows high selectiviyty for this receptor subclass, relative to other nicotinic receptors (>500-fold alpha-3 beta-4, >3500-fold alpha-7, >20,000-fold alpha-1 beta gamma delta) or non-nicotinic receptors and transporters (>2000-fold). The drug competitively inhibits the ability of nicotine to bind to and activate the alpha-4 beta-2 receptor. The drug exerts mild agonistic activity at this site, though at a level much lower than nicotine; it is presumed that this activation eases withdrawal symptoms."
DB01274,Arformoterol,CHEMBL1363,"While it is recognized that β2-receptors are the predominant adrenergic receptors in bronchial smooth muscle and β1-receptors are the predominant receptors in the heart, data indicate that there are also β2-receptors in the human heart comprising 10% to 50% of the total beta-adrenergic receptors. The precise function of these receptors has not been established, but they raise the possibility that even highly selective β2-agonists may have cardiac effects. The pharmacologic effects of β2-adrenoceptor agonist drugs, including arformoterol, are at least in part attributable to stimulation of intracellular adenyl cyclase, the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to cyclic-3&prime;,5&prime;-adenosine monophosphate (cyclic AMP). Increased intracellular cyclic AMP levels cause relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle and inhibition of release of proinflammatory mediators from cells, especially from mast cells. In vitro tests show that arformoterol is an inhibitor of the release of mast cell mediators, such as histamine and leukotrienes, from the human lung. Arformoterol also inhibits histamine-induced plasma albumin extravasation in anesthetized guinea pigs and inhibits allergen-induced eosinophil influx in dogs with airway hyper-response."
DB01275,Hydralazine,CHEMBL276832,"Although the precise mechanism of action of hydralazine is not fully understood, the major effects are on the cardiovascular system. Hydralazine apparently lowers blood pressure by exerting a peripheral vasodilating effect through a direct relaxation of vascular smooth muscle. It has also been suggested that cyclic 3',5'-adenosine monophosphate (cyclic AMP) mediates, at least partly, the relaxation of arterial smooth muscle by altering cellular calcium metabolism, which interferes with the calcium movements within the vascular smooth muscle that are responsible for initiating or maintaining the contractile state. In hypertensive patients, the hydralazine-induced decrease in blood pressure is accompanied by increased heart rate, cardiac output, and stroke volume, probably because of a reflex response to decreased peripheral resistance. The drug has no direct effect on the heart. Hydralazine may increase pulmonary arterial pressure, as well as coronary, splanchnic, cerebral, and renal blood flow.  The preferential dilatation of arterioles, as compared to veins, minimizes postural hypotension and promotes the increase in cardiac output. Hydralazine usually increases renin activity in plasma, presumably as a result of increased secretion of renin by the renal juxtaglomerular cells in response to reflex sympathetic discharge. This increase in renin activity leads to the production of angiotensin II, which then causes stimulation of aldosterone and consequent sodium reabsorption. Tolerance to the antihypertensive effect of the drug develops during prolonged therapy, especially if a diuretic is not administered concurrently. In patients with CHF, hydralazine decreases systemic vascular resistance and increases cardiac output."
DB01276,Exenatide,CHEMBL414357,"Exenatide is a functional analog of the human incretin Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 (GLP-1). Incretins enhance glucose-dependent insulin secretion and exhibit other antihyperglycemic actions following their release into the circulation from the gut. The GLP-1 system increases insulin secretion only in the presence of elevated plasma glucose levels, avoiding inappropriately high insulin levels during fasting. The drug also moderates peak serum glucagon levels during hyperglycemic periods following meals, but does not interfere with glucagon release in response to hypoglycemia. Secondary effects of drug administration reduces the rate of gastric emptying and decreases food intake, mitigating the potential severity of hyperglycemic events after meals."
DB01277,Mecasermin,CHEMBL1201716,"Mecasermin supplies recombinant-DNA-origin IGF-1, which binds to the Type I IGF-1 receptor. This receptor exerts intra-cellular signaling activity in a number of processes involved in statural growth, including mitogenesis in multiple tissue types, chondrocyte growth and division along cartilage growth plates, and increases in organ growth. "
DB01278,Pramlintide,CHEMBL2103758,"Pramlintide is an amlyinomimetic, a functional analog of the naturally occurring pancreatic hormone amylin. Amylin has activity in a number of gastrointestinal and glucodynamic systems, and by mimicking its activity, pramlintide acts to improve glycemic control through modulation of the rate of gastric emptying, prevention of post-prandial rise in glucagon levels, and by increasing sensations of satiety, thereby reducing caloric intake and potentiating weight loss. There appears to be at least three distinct receptor complexes that bind with high affinity to amylin. All three complexes contain the calcitonin receptor at the core, plus one of three Receptor activity-modifying proteins, RAMP1, RAMP2, or RAMP3."
DB01279,Galsulfase,CHEMBL1201822,"Galsulfase supplies recombinant-engineered galsulfase, a normal variant form of the polymorphic human enzyme, N-acetylgalactosamine 4-sulfatase. It is a lysosomal hydrolase that catalyzes the cleavage of the sulfate ester from terminal N-acetylgalactosamine 4-sulfate residues of GAG chondroitin 4-sulfate and dermatan sulfate. Increased catabolism of GAG in turn reduces systemic dermatan sulfate accumulation, thereby reducing the primary symptoms of MPS VI."
DB01280,Nelarabine,CHEMBL1201112,"Once nelarabine is metabolized into ara-GTP, the metabolite accumulates in leukemic blasts and incorporates into DNA to exert its S phase-specific cytotoxic effects, leading to the induction of fragmentation and apoptosis. Ara-GTP competes with endogenous deoxyGTP (dGTP) for incorporation into DNA. Once ara-GTP is incorporated at the 3' end of DNA, further DNA elongation is inhibited, which signals apoptosis and leads to cellular destruction. Additional cytotoxic activities may exist, but these are not fully understood."
DB01281,Abatacept,CHEMBL1201823,"Abatacept is a selective costimulation modulator, like CTLA-4, the drug has shown to inhibit T-cell (T lymphocyte) activation by binding to CD80 and CD86, thereby blocking interaction with CD28. Blockade of this interaction has been shown to inhibit the delivery of the second co-stimulatory signal required for optimal activation of T-cells. This results in the inhibition of autoimmune T-Cell activation that has been implcated in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis."
DB01282,Carbetocin,CHEMBL3301668,"Carbetocin binds to oxytocin receptors present on the smooth musculature of the uterus, resulting in rhythmic contractions of the uterus, increased frequency of existing contractions, and increased uterine tone. The oxytocin receptor content of the uterus is very low in the non-pregnant state, and increases during pregnancy, reaching a peak at the time of delivery."
DB01283,Lumiracoxib,CHEMBL404108,The mechanism of action of lumiracoxib is due to inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis via inhibition of cyclooygenase-2 (COX-2). Lumiracoxib does not inhibit COX-1 at therapeutic concentrations.
DB01284,Tetracosactide,CHEMBL2103784,"Cosyntropin combines with a specific receptor in the adrenal cell plasma membrane and, in patients with normal adrenocortical function, stimulates the initial reaction involved in the synthesis of adrenal steroids (including cortisol, cortisone, weak androgenic substances, and a limited quantity of aldosterone) from cholesterol by increasing the quantity of the substrate within the mitochondria. Cosyntropin does not significantly increase plasma cortisol concentration in patients with primary or secondary adrenocortical insufficiency. "
DB01285,Corticotropin,CHEMBL1201610,"As a diagnostic aid (adrenocortical function), corticotropin combines with a specific receptor on the adrenal cell plasma membrane. In patients with normal adrenocortical function, it stimulates the initial reaction involved in the synthesis of adrenal steroids (including cortisol, cortisone, weak androgenic substances, and a limited quantity of aldosterone) from cholesterol by increasing the quantity of cholesterol within the mitochondria. Corticotropin does not significantly increase serum cortisol concentrations in patients with primary adrenocortical insufficiency (Addison's disease). The mechanism of action of corticotropin in the treatment of infantile myoclonic seizures is unknown."

DB01289,Glisoxepide,CHEMBL2106618,"Glisoxepide is a hypoglycemic sulphonylurea agent. The sulphonylureas are a family of drugs based on a common sulphonylurea core. These drugs act via augmentation of secretion of insulin from pancreatic beta-cells. Sulphonylureas may also cause a reduction in serum glucagon and potentiate the action of insulin at the extrapancreatic tissues.  Glisoxepide functions as a non-selective K(ATP) channel blocker.  It is thought to stimulate insulin secretion by closing the ATP-sensitive K(+) (K(ATP)) channels (Kir6.2/SUR1 complex, KATP channels) in pancreatic beta-cells. This inhibits a tonic, hyperpolarizing efflux of potassium, thus causing the electric potential over the membrane to become more positive. This depolarization opens voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. The rise in intracellular calcium leads to increased fusion of insulin granulae with the cell membrane, and therefore increased secretion of (pro)insulin."
DB01291,Pirbuterol,CHEMBL1094966,"The pharmacologic effects of beta adrenergic agonist drugs, including pirbuterol, are at least in proof attributable to stimulation through beta adrenergic receptors of intracellular adenyl cyclase, the enzyme which catalyzes the conversion of adenosine triphosphate (AlP) to cyclic-3&#8224; ,5&#8224;-adenosine monophosphate (c-AMP). Increased c-AMP levels are associated with relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle and inhibition of release of mediators of immediate hypersensitivity from cells, especially from mast cells."
DB01294,Bismuth Subsalicylate,CHEMBL1120,"As an antidiarrheal, the exact mechanism has not been determined. Bismuth subsalicylate may exert its antidiarrheal action not only by stimulating absorption of fluid and electrolytes across the intestinal wall (antisecretory action) but also, when hydrolyzed to salicylic acid, by inhibiting synthesis of a prostaglandin responsible for intestinal inflammation and hypermotility. In addition, bismuth subsalicylate binds toxins produced by Escherichia coli. Both bismuth subsalicylate and the intestinal reaction products, bismuth oxychloride and bismuth hydroxide, are believed to have bactericidal action. As an antacid, bismuth has weak antacid properties."
DB01295,Bevantolol,CHEMBL314010,"Animal experiments confirm both agonist and antagonist effects on alpha-receptors, in addition to antagonist activity at beta-1 receptors. By binding and antagonizing beta-1 receptors Bevantolol inhibits the normal normal epinephrine-mediated sympathetic actions such as increased heart rate. This has the effect of decreasing preload and blood pressure."
DB01296,Glucosamine,CHEMBL493287,"Glucosamine is an amino sugar and a prominent precursor in the biochemical synthesis of glycosylated proteins and lipids. Oral glucosamine is commonly used for the treatment of osteoarthritis. Since glucosamine is a precursor for glycosaminoglycans, and glycosaminoglycans are a major component of joint cartilage, supplemental glucosamine may help to rebuild cartilage and treat arthritis. Its use as a therapy for osteoarthritis appears safe, but there is conflicting evidence as to its effectiveness with more recent studies showing limited to no clinical benefit of use. In the United States, glucosamine is not approved by the Food and Drug Administration for medical use in humans. Since glucosamine is classified as a dietary supplement, safety and formulation are solely the responsibility of the manufacturer; evidence of safety and efficacy is not required as long as it is not advertised as a treatment for a medical condition."
DB01297,Practolol,CHEMBL6995,"Like other beta-adrenergic antagonists, practolol competes with adrenergic neurotransmitters such as catecholamines for binding at sympathetic receptor sites. Like propranolol and timolol, practolol binds at beta(1)-adrenergic receptors in the heart and vascular smooth muscle, inhibiting the effects of the catecholamines epinephrine and norepinephrine and decreasing heart rate, cardiac output, and systolic and diastolic blood pressure."
DB01298,Sulfacytine,CHEMBL1201056,"Sulfacytine is a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme dihydropteroate synthetase. It inhibits bacterial synthesis of of dihydrofolic acid by preventing the condensation of the pteridine with para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA), a substrate of the enzyme dihydropteroate synthetase. The inhibited reaction is necessary in these organisms for the synthesis of folic acid."
DB01299,Sulfadoxine,CHEMBL1539,"Sulfadoxine is a sulfa drug, often used in combination with pyrimethamine  to treat malaria. This medicine may also be used to prevent malaria in people who are living in, or will be traveling to, an area where there is a chance of getting malaria. Sulfadoxine targets Plasmodium dihydropteroate synthase and dihydrofolate reductase.  Sulfa drugs or Sulfonamides are antimetabolites.  They compete with para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) for incorporation into folic acid. The action of sulfonamides exploits the difference between mammal cells and other kinds of cells in their folic acid metabolism. All cells require folic acid for growth. Folic acid (as a vitamin) diffuses or is transported into human cells. However, folic acid cannot cross bacterial (and certain protozoan) cell walls by diffusion or active transport. For this reason bacteria must synthesize folic acid from p-aminobenzoic acid."
DB01301,Rolitetracycline,CHEMBL1237046,"Rolitetracycline  is a semisynthetic broad-spectrum tetracycline antibiotic used especially for parenteral administration in cases requiring high concentrations or when oral administration is impractical. Rolitetracycline passively diffuses through porin channels in the bacterial membrane and reversibly binds to the 30S ribosomal subunit, preventing binding of tRNA to the mRNA-ribosome complex, and thus interfering with protein synthesis."
DB01303,Oxtriphylline,CHEMBL1200434,"Oxtriphylline is a choline salt of theophylline. After ingestion, theophylline is released from oxytriphylline, and theophylline relaxes the smooth muscle of the bronchial airways and pulmonary blood vessels and reduces airway responsiveness to histamine, methacholine, adenosine, and allergen. Theophylline competitively inhibits type III and type IV phosphodiesterase (PDE), the enzyme responsible for breaking down cyclic AMP in smooth muscle cells, possibly resulting in bronchodilation. Theophylline also binds to the adenosine A2B receptor and blocks adenosine mediated bronchoconstriction. In inflammatory states, theophylline activates histone deacetylase to prevent transcription of inflammatory genes that require the acetylation of histones for transcription to begin.

DB01306,Insulin Aspart,CHEMBL1201496,"Insulin aspart binds to the insulin receptor (IR), a heterotetrameric protein consisting of two extracellular alpha units and two transmembrane beta units. The binding of insulin to the alpha subunit of IR stimulates the tyrosine kinase activity intrinsic to the beta subunit of the receptor. The bound receptor autophosphorylates and phosphorylates numerous intracellular substrates such as insulin receptor substrates (IRS) proteins, Cbl, APS, Shc and Gab 1. Activation of these proteins leads to the activation of downstream signaling molecules including PI3 kinase and Akt. Akt regulates the activity of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) and protein kinase C (PKC), both of which play critical roles in metabolism and catabolism. In humans, insulin is stored in the form of hexamers; however, only insulin monomers are able to interact with IR. Substitution of the proline residue at B28 with aspartic acid reduces the tendency to form hexamers and results in a faster rate of absorption and onset of action and shorter duration of action. "
DB01307,Insulin Detemir,CHEMBL2104391,"Insulin detemir binds to the insulin receptor (IR), a heterotetrameric protein consisting of two extracellular alpha units and two transmembrane beta units.

The bound receptor autophosphorylates and phosphorylates numerous intracellular substrates such as insulin receptor substrates (IRS) proteins, Cbl, APS, Shc and Gab 1. Activation of these proteins leads to the activation of downstream signaling molecules including PI3 kinase and Akt. Akt regulates the activity of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) and protein kinase C (PKC), both of which play critical roles in metabolism and catabolism.
Insulin detemir’s long duration of action appears to be a result of slow systemic absorption from the injection site and delayed distribution to target tissues. The myristic acid side chain on insulin detemir increases self-association and gives it a high binding affinity to serum albumin. These features slows its distribution into target tissues and prolongs its duration of action. "
DB01309,Insulin Glulisine,CHEMBL1201613,"Insulin glulisine binds to the insulin receptor (IR), a heterotetrameric protein consisting of two extracellular alpha units and two transmembrane beta units. The binding of insulin to the alpha subunit of IR stimulates the tyrosine kinase activity intrinsic to the beta subunit of the receptor. The bound receptor autophosphorylates and phosphorylates numerous intracellular substrates such as insulin receptor substrates (IRS) proteins, Cbl, APS, Shc and Gab 1. Activation of these proteins leads to the activation of downstream signaling molecules including PI3 kinase and Akt. Akt regulates the activity of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) and protein kinase C (PKC), both of which play critical roles in metabolism and catabolism. In humans, insulin is stored in the form of hexamers; however, only insulin monomers are able to interact with IR. Substitution of the arginine at position B3 for lysine and replacement of the B29 lysine with glutamic acid decreases the propensity to form hexamers, stabilizes the hormone in monomeric form and results in a rapid rate of absorption and short duration of action.

DB01319,Fosamprenavir,CHEMBL1664,"Fosamprenavir is a prodrug that is rapidly hydrolyzed to amprenavir by cellular phosphatases in the gut epithelium as it is absorbed. Amprenavir is an inhibitor of HIV-1 protease. During HIV replication, HIV protease cleaves viral polypeptide products of the Gag and Gag-Pol genes to form structural proteins of the virion core and essential viral enzymes. Amprenavir interferes with this process by binding to the active site of HIV-1 protease, thereby preventing the processing of viral Gag and Gag-Pol polyprotein precursors, resulting in the formation of immature non-infectious viral particles."
DB01320,Fosphenytoin,CHEMBL1201336,"Fosphenytoin is a prodrug of phenytoin and accordingly, its anticonvulsant effects are attributable to phenytoin. Phenytoin acts on sodium channels on the neuronal cell membrane, limiting the spread of seizure activity and reducing seizure propagation. By promoting sodium efflux from neurons, phenytoin tends to stabilize the threshold against hyperexcitability caused by excessive stimulation or environmental changes capable of reducing membrane sodium gradient. This includes the reduction of post-tetanic potentiation at synapses. Loss of post-tetanic potentiation prevents cortical seizure foci from detonating adjacent cortical areas."
DB01321,Josamycin,CHEMBL224436,"The mechanism of action of macrolides such as Josamycin is via inhibition of bacterial protein biosynthesis by binding reversibly to the subunit 50S of the bacterial ribosome, thereby inhibiting translocation of peptidyl tRNA. This action is mainly bacteriostatic, but can also be bactericidal in high concentrations. Macrolides tend to accumulate within leukocytes, and are therefore actually transported into the site of infection."

DB01356,Lithium,CHEMBL1234004,"The precise mechanism of action of Li+ as a mood-stabilizing agent is currently unknown. It is possible that Li+ produces its effects by interacting with the transport of monovalent or divalent cations in neurons. An increasing number of scientists have come to the conclusion that the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate is the key factor in understanding how lithium works. Lithium has been shown to change the inward and outward currents of glutamate receptors (especially GluR3), without a shift in reversal potential. Lithium has been found to exert a dual effect on glutamate receptors, acting to keep the amount of glutamate active between cells at a stable, healthy level, neither too much nor too little.  It is postulated that too much glutamate in the space between neurons causes mania, and too little, depression. Another mechanism by which lithium might help to regulate mood include the non-competitive inhibition of an enzyme called inositol monophosphatase.  Alternately lithium's action may be enhanced through the deactivation of the GSK-3B enzyme.  The regulation of GSK-3B by lithium may affect the circadian clock.  GSK-3 is known for phosphorylating and thus inactivating glycogen synthase. GSK-3B has also been implicated in the control of cellular response to damaged DNA. GSK-3 normally phosphorylates beta catenin, which leads to beta catenin degratation. When GSK-3 is inhibited, beta catenin increases and transgenic mice with overexpression of beta catenin express similar behaviour to mice treated with lithium. These results suggest that increase of beta catenin may be a possible pathway for the therapeutic action of lithium. "

Astringent medicines cause shrinkage of mucous membranes or exposed tissues and are often used internally to check discharge of blood serum or mucous secretions. This can happen with a sore throat, hemorrhages, diarrhea, or with peptic ulcers. Externally applied astringents, which cause mild coagulation of skin proteins, dry, harden, and protect the skin. Acne sufferers are often advised to use astringents if they have oily skin. Astringents also help heal stretch marks and other scars.

DB01373,Calcium,,"Calcium plays a vital role in the anatomy, physiology and biochemistry of organisms and of the cell, particularly in signal transduction pathways. More than 500 human proteins are known to bind or transport calcium.   The skeleton acts as a major mineral storage site for the element and releases Ca2+ ions into the bloodstream under controlled conditions. Circulating calcium is either in the free, ionized form or bound to blood proteins such as serum albumin. Parathyroid hormone (secreted from the parathyroid gland) regulates the resorption of Ca2+ from bone. Calcitonin stimulates incorporation of calcium in bone, although this process is largely independent of calcitonin. Although calcium flow to and from the bone is neutral, about 5 mmol is turned over a day. Bone serves as an important storage point for calcium, as it contains 99% of the total body calcium.  Low calcium intake may also be a risk factor in the development of osteoporosis.  The best-absorbed form of calcium from a pill is a calcium salt like carbonate or phosphate. Calcium gluconate and calcium lactate are absorbed well by pregnant women. Seniors absorb calcium lactate, gluconate and citrate better unless they take their calcium supplement with a full breakfast. The currently recommended calcium intake is 1,500 milligrams per day for women not taking estrogen and 800 milligrams per day for women on estrogen. There is close to 300 milligrams of calcium in one cup of fluid milk. Calcium carbonate is currently the best and least expensive form of calcium supplement available."

The gastric acid may also reach ulcers in the esophagus or the duodenum. Other mechanisms may contribute, such as the effect of aluminum ions inhibiting smooth muscle cell contraction and delaying gastric emptying.  Aluminum is known to bind troponin C (a muscle protein) and to interfere with voltage-dependent calcium transport.

DB01380,Cortisone acetate,CHEMBL1650,"Cortisone acetate binds to the cytosolic glucocorticoid receptor. After binding the receptor the newly formed receptor-ligand complex translocates itself into the cell nucleus, where it binds to many glucocorticoid response elements (GRE) in the promoter region of the target genes. The DNA bound receptor then interacts with basic transcription factors, causing the increase in expression of specific target genes. The anti-inflammatory actions of corticosteroids are thought to involve lipocortins, phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins which, through inhibition arachidonic acid, control the biosynthesis of prostaglandins and leukotrienes. Specifically glucocorticoids induce lipocortin-1 (annexin-1) synthesis, which then binds to cell membranes preventing the phospholipase A2 from coming into contact with its substrate arachidonic acid. This leads to diminished eicosanoid production. The cyclooxygenase (both COX-1 and COX-2) expression is also suppressed, potentiating the effect. In other words, the two main products in inflammation Prostaglandins and Leukotrienes are inhibited by the action of Glucocorticoids. Glucocorticoids also stimulate the lipocortin-1 escaping to the extracellular space, where it binds to the leukocyte membrane receptors and inhibits various inflammatory events: epithelial adhesion, emigration, chemotaxis, phagocytosis, respiratory burst and the release of various inflammatory mediators (lysosomal enzymes, cytokines, tissue plasminogen activator, chemokines etc.) from neutrophils, macrophages and mastocytes. Additionally the immune system is suppressed by corticosteroids due to a decrease in the function of the lymphatic system, a reduction in immunoglobulin and complement concentrations, the precipitation of lymphocytopenia, and interference with antigen-antibody binding."

DB01382,Glycodiazine,CHEMBL1697838,"The mechanism of action of glycodiazine in lowering blood glucose appears to be dependent on stimulating the release of insulin from functioning pancreatic beta cells, and increasing sensitivity of peripheral tissues to insulin. Glycodiazine likely binds to ATP-sensitive potassium channel receptors on the pancreatic cell surface, reducing potassium conductance and causing depolarization of the membrane. Membrane depolarization stimulates calcium ion influx through voltage-sensitive calcium channels. The rise in intracellular calcium leads to increased fusion of insulin granulae with the cell membrane, and therefore increased secretion of (pro)insulin."
DB01384,Paramethasone,CHEMBL1579,"Glucocorticoids such as paramethasone can inhibit leukocyte infiltration at the site of inflammation, interfere with mediators of inflammatory response, and suppress humoral immune responses. The antiinflammatory actions of glucocorticoids are thought to involve phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins, lipocortins, which control the biosynthesis of potent mediators of inflammation such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes. Paramethasone reduces inflammatory reaction by limiting the capillary dilatation and permeability of the vascular structures. These compounds restrict the accumulation of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and macrophages and reduce the release of vasoactive kinins. Recent research suggests that corticosteroids may inhibit the release of arachidonic acid from phospholipids, thereby reducing the formation of prostaglandins. Prednisolone is a glucocorticoid receptor agonist. On binding, the corticoreceptor-ligand complex translocates itself into the cell nucleus, where it binds to many glucocorticoid response elements (GRE) in the promoter region of the target genes. The DNA bound receptor then interacts with basic transcription factors, causing an increase or decrease in expression of specific target genes, including suppression of IL2 (interleukin 2) expression."
DB01388,Mibefradil,CHEMBL45816,"Mibefradil is a tetralol calcium channel blocking agent that inhibits the influx of calcium ions across both the T (low-voltage) and L (high-voltage) calcium channels of cardiac and vascular smooth muscle, with a greater selectivity for T channels. Vasodilation occurs in vascular smooth muscle, causing a decrease in peripheral vascular resistance and a resulting decrease in blood pressure. Mibefradil causes a slight increase in cardiac output during chronic dosing. Mibefradil slows sinus and atrioventricular (AV) node conduction, producing a slight reduction in heart rate and a slight increase in the PR interval. It has also been shown to slightly lengthen the corrected sinus node recovery time and AH interval and to raise the Wenckebach point. The mechanism by which mibefradil reduces angina is not known, but is thought to be attributed to a reduction in heart rate, total peripheral resistance (afterload), and the heart rate&ndash;systolic blood pressure product at any given level of exercise. The result of these effects is a decrease in cardiac workload and myocardial oxygen demand."
DB01390,Sodium bicarbonate,CHEMBL1353,"Sodium bicarbonate is a systemic alkalizer, which increases plasma bicarbonate, buffers excess hydrogen ion concentration, and raises blood pH, thereby reversing the clinical manifestations of acidosis. It is also a urinary alkalizer, increasing the excretion of free bicarbonate ions in the urine, thus effectively raising the urinary pH. By maintaining an alkaline urine, the actual dissolution of uric acid stones may be accomplished. Sodium bicarbonate acts as an antacid and reacts chemically to neutralize or buffer existing quantities of stomach acid but has no direct effect on its output. This action results in increased pH value of stomach contents, thus providing relief of hyperacidity symptoms. [PharmGKB]"
DB01392,Yohimbine,CHEMBL15245,"Yohimbine is a pre-synaptic alpha 2-adrenergic blocking agent. The exact mechanism for its use in impotence has not been fully elucidated. However, yohimbine may exert its beneficial effect on erectile ability through blockade of central alpha 2-adrenergic receptors producing an increase in sympathetic drive secondary to an increase in norepinephrine release and in firing rate of cells in the brain noradrenergic nuclei. Yohimbine-mediated norepinephrine release at the level of the corporeal tissues may also be involved. In addition, beneficial effects may involve other neurotransmitters such as dopamine and serotonin and cholinergic receptors."
DB01393,Bezafibrate,CHEMBL264374,"Like the other fibrates, bezafibrate is an agonist of PPAR&alpha;; some studies suggest it may have some activity on PPAR&gamma; and PPAR&delta; as well."
DB01394,Colchicine,CHEMBL87,"The precise mechanism of action has not been completely established. In patients with gout, colchicine apparently interrupts the cycle of monosodium urate crystal deposition in joint tissues and the resultant inflammatory response that initiates and sustains an acute attack. Colchicine decreases leukocyte chemotaxis and phagocytosis and inhibits the formation and release of a chemotactic glycoprotein that is produced during phagocytosis of urate crystals. Colchicine also inhibits urate crystal deposition, which is enhanced by a low pH in the tissues, probably by inhibiting oxidation of glucose and subsequent lactic acid production in leukocytes. Colchicine has no analgesic or antihyperuricemic activity. Colchicine inhibits microtubule assembly in various cells, including leukocytes, probably by binding to and interfering with polymerization of the microtubule subunit tubulin. Although some studies have found that this action probably does not contribute significantly to colchicine's antigout action, a recent in vitro study has shown that it may be at least partially involved."
DB01395,Drospirenone,CHEMBL1509,"Progestins such as drospirenone diffuse freely into target cells in the female reproductive tract, mammary gland, hypothalamus, and the pituitary and bind to the progesterone receptor. Once bound to the receptor, progestins slow the frequency of release of gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) from the hypothalamus and blunt the pre-ovulatory LH surge."
DB01396,Digitoxin,CHEMBL254219,"Digitoxin inhibits the Na-K-ATPase membrane pump, resulting in an increase in intracellular sodium and calcium concentrations. Increased intracellular concentrations of calcium may promote activation of contractile proteins (e.g., actin, myosin). Digitoxin also acts on the electrical activity of the heart, increasing the slope of phase 4 depolarization, shortening the action potential duration, and decreasing the maximal diastolic potential."
DB01397,Magnesium salicylate,CHEMBL2106755,"Most NSAIDs act as nonselective inhibitors of the enzyme cyclooxygenase (COX), inhibiting both the cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) isoenzymes. COX catalyzes the formation of prostaglandins and thromboxane from arachidonic acid (itself derived from the cellular phospholipid bilayer by phospholipase A2). Prostaglandins act (among other things) as messenger molecules in the process of inflammation."
DB01399,Salsalate,CHEMBL154111,"The mode of anti-inflammatory action of salsalate and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs is not fully defined, but appears to be primarily associated with inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis. This inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis is done through the inactivation of cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and COX-2, which are reponsible for catalyzing the formation of prostaglandins in the arachidonic acid pathway. Although salicylic acid (the primary metabolite of salsalate) is a weak inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis in vitro, salsalate appears to selectively inhibit prostaglandin synthesis in vivo, providing anti-inflammatory activity equivalent to aspirin and indomethacin. Unlike aspirin, salsalate does not inhibit platelet aggregation."
DB01400,Neostigmine,CHEMBL278020,"Neostigmine is a parasympathomimetic, specifically, a reversible cholinesterase inhibitor. The drug inhibits acetylcholinesterase which is responsible for the degredation of acetylcholine. So, with acetylcholinesterase inhibited, more acetylcholine is present By interfering with the breakdown of acetylcholine, neostigmine indirectly stimulates both nicotinic and muscarinic receptors which are involved in muscle contraction.. It does not cross the blood-brain barrier."

DB01405,Temafloxacin,CHEMBL277100,"The bactericidal action of temafloxacin results from interference with the activity of the bacterial enzymes DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV, which are needed for the transcription and replication of bacterial DNA. DNA gyrase appears to be the primary quinolone target for gram-negative bacteria. Topoisomerase IV appears to be the preferential target in gram-positive organisms. Interference with these two topoisomerases results in strand breakage of the bacterial chromosome, supercoiling, and resealing. As a result DNA replication and transcription is inhibited."
DB01406,Danazol,CHEMBL1479,"As a gonadotropin inhibitor, danazol suppresses the pituitary-ovarian axis possibly by inhibiting the output of pituitary gonadotropins. Danazol also depresses the preovulatory surge in output of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH), thereby reducing ovarian estrogen production. Danazol may also directly inhibits ovarian steroidogenesis; bind to androgen, progesterone, and glucocorticoid receptors; bind to sex-hormone-binding globulin and corticosteroid-binding globulin; and increases the metabolic clearance rate of progesterone. Another mechanism of action by which danazol may use to facilitate regression of endometriosis is by decreasing IgG, IgM, and IgA concentrations, as well as phospholipid and IgG isotope autoantibodies. In the treatment of endometriosis, as a consequence of suppression of ovarian function,  danazol causes both normal and ectopic endometrial tissues to become inactive and atrophic. This leads to anovulation and associated amenorrhea. In fibrocystic breast disease, the exact mechanism of action of danazol is unknown, but may be related to suppressed estrogenic stimulation as a result of decreased ovarian production of estrogen. A direct effect on steroid receptor sites in breast tissue is also possible. This leads to a disappearance of nodularity, relief of pain and tenderness, and possibly changes in the menstrual pattern. In terms of hereditary angioedema, danazol corrects the underlying biochemical deficiency by increasing serum concentrations of the deficient C1 esterase inhibitor, resulting in increased serum concentrations of the C4 component of the complement system.

DB01407,Clenbuterol,CHEMBL49080,Clenbuterol is a Beta(2) agonist similar in some structural respects to salbutamol. Agonism of the beta(2) receptor stimulates adenylyl cyclase activity which ultimately leads to downstream effects of smooth muscle relaxation in the bronchioles.
DB01408,Bambuterol,CHEMBL521589,"The pharmacologic effects of bambuterol are at least in part attributable to stimulation through beta-adrenergic receptors (beta 2 receptors) of intracellular adenyl cyclase, the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to cyclic AMP. Increased cyclic AMP levels are associated with relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle and inhibition of release of mediators of immediate hypersensitivity from cells, especially from mast cells."
DB01409,Tiotropium,CHEMBL1900528,"Tiotropium is a muscarinic receptor antagonist, often referred to as an antimuscarinic or anticholinergic agent. Although it does not display selectivity for specific muscarinic receptors, on topical application it acts mainly on M3 muscarinic receptors located in the airways to produce smooth muscle relaxation, thus producing a bronchodilatory effect."
DB01410,Ciclesonide,CHEMBL2040682,"Glucocorticoids such as ciclesonide can inhibit leukocyte infiltration at the site of inflammation, interfere with mediators of inflammatory response, and suppress humoral immune responses. The antiinflammatory actions of glucocorticoids are thought to involve phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins, lipocortins, which control the biosynthesis of potent mediators of inflammation such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes. Ciclesonide reduces inflammatory reaction by limiting the capillary dilatation and permeability of the vascular structures. These compounds restrict the accumulation of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and macrophages and reduce the release of vasoactive kinins. Recent research suggests that corticosteroids may inhibit the release of arachidonic acid from phospholipids, thereby reducing the formation of prostaglandins. Ciclesonide is a glucocorticoid receptor agonist. On binding, the corticoreceptor-ligand complex translocates itself into the cell nucleus, where it binds to many glucocorticoid response elements (GRE) in the promoter region of the target genes. The DNA bound receptor then interacts with basic transcription factors, causing an increase or decrease in expression of specific target genes, including suppression of IL2 (interleukin 2) expression."

Pranlukast inhibits the actions of LTD<sub>4</sub> at the CysLT<sub>1</sub> receptor, preventing airway edema, smooth muscle contraction, and enhanced secretion of thick, viscous mucus."
DB01412,Theobromine,CHEMBL1114,"Theobromine stimulates medullary, vagal, vasomotor, and respiratory centers, promoting bradycardia, vasoconstriction, and increased respiratory rate. This action was previously believed to be due primarily to increased intracellular cyclic 3&prime;,5&prime;-adenosine monophosphate (cyclic AMP) following inhibition of phosphodiesterase, the enzyme that degrades cyclic AMP. It is now thought that xanthines such as caffeine and theobromine act as antagonist at adenosine-receptors within the plasma membrane of virtually every cell. As adenosine acts as an autocoid, inhibiting the release of neurotransmitters from presynaptic sites but augmenting the actions of norepinephrine or angiotensin, antagonism of adenosine receptors promotes neurotransmitter release. This explains the stimulatory effects of xanthine derivatives such as theobromine and caffeine. Blockade of the adenosine A1 receptor in the heart leads to the accelerated, pronounced ""pounding"" of the heart upon caffeine intake."
DB01413,Cefepime,CHEMBL186,"Cephalosporins are bactericidal and have the same mode of action as other beta-lactam antibiotics (such as penicillins). Cephalosporins disrupt the synthesis of the peptidoglycan layer of bacterial cell walls. The peptidoglycan layer is important for cell wall structural integrity, especially in Gram-positive organisms. The final transpeptidation step in the synthesis of the peptidoglycan is facilitated by transpeptidases known as penicillin binding proteins (PBPs)."
DB01414,Cefacetrile,CHEMBL2110602,"In vitro tests demonstrate that the bactericidal action of cephalosporins results from inhibition of cell wall synthesis. By binding to specific penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) located inside the bacterial cell wall, it inhibits the third and last stage of bacterial cell wall synthesis. Cell lysis is then mediated by bacterial cell wall autolytic enzymes such as autolysins."
DB01415,Ceftibuten,CHEMBL1605,Ceftibuten exerts its bactericidal action by binding to essential target proteins of the bacterial cell wall. This binding leads to inhibition of cell-wall synthesis.
DB01416,Cefpodoxime,CHEMBL1672,"Cefpodoxime is active against a wide spectrum of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Cefpodoxime is stable in the presence of beta-lactamase enzymes. As a result, many organisms resistant to penicillins and cephalosporins, due to their production of beta-lactamase, may be susceptible to cefpodoxime. Cefpodoxime is inactivated by certain extended spectrum beta-lactamases. The bactericidal activity of cefpodoxime results from its inhibition of cell wall synthesis. The active metabolite of cefpodoxime binds preferentially to penicillin binding protein 3, which inhibits production of peptidoglycan, the primary constituent of bacterial cell walls."
DB01418,Acenocoumarol,CHEMBL397420,"Acenocoumarol inhibits vitamin K reductase, resulting in depletion of the reduced form of vitamin K (vitamin KH2). As vitamin K is a cofactor for the carboxylation of glutamate residues on the N-terminal regions of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors, this limits the gamma-carboxylation and subsequent activation of the vitamin K-dependent coagulant proteins. The synthesis of vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors II, VII, IX, and X and anticoagulant proteins C and S is inhibited resulting in decreased prothrombin levels and a decrease in the amount of thrombin generated and bound to fibrin. This reduces the thrombogenicity of clots."
DB01419,Antrafenine,CHEMBL345524,"Antrafenine is believed to be associated with the inhibition of cyclooxygenase activity. Two unique cyclooxygenases have been described in mammals. The constitutive cyclooxygenase, COX-1, synthesizes prostaglandins necessary for normal gastrointestinal and renal function. The inducible cyclooxygenase, COX-2, generates prostaglandins involved in inflammation. Inhibition of COX-1 is thought to be associated with gastrointestinal and renal toxicity while inhibition of COX-2 provides anti-inflammatory activity."
DB01420,Testosterone Propionate,CHEMBL1170,"The effects of testosterone in humans and other vertebrates occur by way of two main mechanisms: by activation of the androgen receptor (directly or as DHT), and by conversion to estradiol and activation of certain estrogen receptors. Free testosterone (T) is transported into the cytoplasm of target tissue cells, where it can bind to the androgen receptor, or can be reduced to 5&alpha;-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) by the cytoplasmic enzyme 5&alpha;-reductase. DHT binds to the same androgen receptor even more strongly than T, so that its androgenic potency is about 2.5 times that of T. The T-receptor or DHT-receptor complex undergoes a structural change that allows it to move into the cell nucleus and bind directly to specific nucleotide sequences of the chromosomal DNA. The areas of binding are called hormone response elements (HREs), and influence transcriptional activity of certain genes, producing the androgen effects."
DB01421,Paromomycin,CHEMBL370143,"Paromomycin inhibits protein synthesis by binding to 16S ribosomal RNA. Bacterial proteins are synthesized by ribosomal RNA complexes which are composed of 2 subunits, a large subunit (50s) and small (30s) subunit, which forms a 70s ribosomal subunit. tRNA binds to the top of this ribosomal structure. Paramomycin binds to the A site, which causes defective polypeptide chains to be produced. Continuous production of defective proteins eventually leads to bacterial death."
DB01422,Nitroxoline,CHEMBL1454910,This drug may also have antitumor activity by inhibition of type 2 methionine aminopeptidase (MetAP2) protein which is involved in angiogenesis. Its antibacterial activity may stem from the metal ion complexation vital for bacterial growth.

DB01431,Allylestrenol,CHEMBL3185133,"Allylestrenol is similar in structure and function to progesterone. Progesterone shares the pharmacological actions of the progestins. Progesterone binds to the progesterone and estrogen receptors. Target cells include the female reproductive tract, the mammary gland, the hypothalamus, and the pituitary. Once bound to the receptor, progestins like Progesterone will slow the frequency of release of gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) from the hypothalamus and blunt the pre-ovulatory LH (luteinizing hormone) surge. In women who have adequate endogenous estrogen, progesterone transforms a proliferative endometrium into a secretory one. Progesterone is essential for the development of decidual tissue and is necessary to increase endometrial receptivity for implantation of an embryo. Once an embryo has been implanted, progesterone acts to maintain the pregnancy. Progesterone also stimulates the growth of mammary alveolar tissue and relaxes uterine smooth muscle. It has little estrogenic and androgenic activity."
DB01432,Cholestyramine,CHEMBL1201625,"Cholestyramine binds bile in the gastrointestinal tract to prevent its reabsorption. The resin is a strong anion exchange resin, which means that it can exchange its chloride anions with anionic bile acids in the gastrointestinal tract and bind them strongly in the resin matrix.

DB01436,Alfacalcidol,CHEMBL1601669,"The first step involved in the activation of vitamin D3 is a 25-hydroxylation which is catalysed by the 25-hydroxylase in the liver and then by other enzymes. The mitochondrial sterol 27-hydroxylase catalyses the first reaction in the oxidation of the side chain of sterol intermediates. The active form of vitamin D3 (calcitriol) binds to intracellular receptors that then function as transcription factors to modulate gene expression. Like the receptors for other steroid hormones and thyroid hormones, the vitamin D receptor has hormone-binding and DNA-binding domains. The vitamin D receptor forms a complex with another intracellular receptor, the retinoid-X receptor, and that heterodimer is what binds to DNA. In most cases studied, the effect is to activate transcription, but situations are also known in which vitamin D suppresses transcription. Calcitriol increases the serum calcium concentrations by: increasing GI absorption of phosphorus and calcium, increasing osteoclastic resorption, and increasing distal renal tubular reabsorption of calcium. Calcitriol appears to promote intestinal absorption of calcium through binding to the vitamin D receptor in the mucosal cytoplasm of the intestine. Subsequently, calcium is absorbed through formation of a calcium-binding protein."

DB01440,Gamma Hydroxybutyric Acid,,"GHB reaches much higher concentrations in the brain and activates GABAB receptors, which are primarily responsible for its sedative effects. GHB receptors are densely expressed in many areas of the brain, including the cortex and hippocampus, and these are the receptors that GHB displays the highest affinity for. There has been somewhat limited research into the GHB receptor; however, there is evidence that activation of the GHB receptor in some brain areas results in the release of glutamate, the principal excitatory neurotransmitter.
Activation of both the GHB receptor and GABA(B) is responsible for the addictive profile of GHB. GHB's effect on dopamine release is biphasic,[19] low concentrations stimulate dopamine release via the GHB receptor.[20] Higher concentrations inhibit dopamine release via GABA(B) receptors as do other GABA(B) agonists such as baclofen and phenibut.[21] After an initial phase of inhibition, dopamine release is then increased via the GHB receptor. This explains the paradoxical mix of sedative and stimulatory properties of GHB, as well as the so-called ""rebound"" effect, experienced by individuals using GHB as a sleeping agent, wherein they awake suddenly after several hours of GHB-induced deep sleep. That is to say that, over time, the concentration of GHB in the system decreases below the threshold for significant GABAB receptor activation and activates predominantly the GHB receptor, leading to wakefulness."

Heroin, along with other opioids, are agonists to four endogenous neurotransmitters. They are beta-endorphin, dynorphin, leu-enkephalin, and met-enkephalin. The body responds to heroin in the brain by reducing (and sometimes stopping) production of the endogenous opioids when heroin is present. Endorphins are regularly released in the brain and nerves, attenuating pain.

It also acts as a weak 5-HT1 and 5-HT2 receptor agonist.
MDMA's unusual entactogenic effects have been hypothesized to be, at least partly, the result of indirect oxytocin secretion via activation of the serotonin system. Oxytocin is a hormone released following events like hugging, orgasm, and childbirth, and is thought to facilitate bonding and the establishment of trust. Based on studies in rats, MDMA is believed to cause the release of oxytocin, at least in part, by both directly and indirectly agonizing the serotonin 5-HT1A receptor."

This inhibition of DAT blocks the reuptake of dopamine and norepinephrine into the presynaptic neuron, increasing the amount of dopamine in the synapse. It also stimulates the release of dopamine and norepinephrine into the synapse. Finally, it increases the magnitude of dopamine release after a stimulus, increasing the salience of stimulus. Also unlike amphetamines, fencamfamine does not inhibit the action of monoamine oxidase enzymes and so is somewhat safer. Some experiments also suggest a role for opioid receptors in the activity of fencamfamine, as low doses can cause paradoxical sedation, and some effects of the drug are blocked by naloxone."

In cytomegalovirus (CMV)-infected cells, ganciclovir is initially phosphorylated to the monophosphate form by viral protein kinase, then it is further phosphorylated via cellular kinases to produce the triphosphate form. This triphosphate form is slowly metabolized intracellularly. The phosphorylation is dependent upon the viral kinase and occurs preferentially in virus-infected cells. The virustatic activity of ganciclovir is due to the inhibition of viral DNA synthesis by ganciclovir triphosphate. Ganciclovir triphosphate is incorporated into the DNA strand replacing many of the adenosine bases. This results in the prevention of DNA synthesis, as phosphodiester bridges can longer to be built, destabilizing the strand. Ganciclovir inhibits viral DNA polymerases more effectively than it does cellular polymerase, and chain elongation resumes when ganciclovir is removed."

In suppressive treatment, hydroxychloroquine inhibits the erythrocytic stage of development of plasmodia. In acute attacks of malaria, it interrupts erythrocytic schizogony of the parasite. Its ability to concentrate in parasitized erythrocytes may account for their selective toxicity against the erythrocytic stages of plasmodial infection. As an antirheumatic, hydroxychloroquine is thought to act as a mild immunosuppressant, inhibiting the production of rheumatoid factor and acute phase reactants.

As an antidote (to cyanide poisoning), amyl nitrite promotes formation of methemoglobin, which combines with cyanide to form nontoxic cyanmethemoglobin."
DB01613,Erythrityl Tetranitrate,CHEMBL2107583,"Similar to other nitrites and organic nitrates, erythrityl tetranitrate is converted to an active intermediate compound which activates the enzyme guanylate cyclase. This stimulates the synthesis of cyclic guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cGMP) which then activates a series of protein kinase-dependent phosphorylations in the smooth muscle cells, eventually resulting in the dephosphorylation of the myosin light chain of the smooth muscle fiber. The subsequent release of calcium ions results in the relaxation of the smooth muscle cells and vasodilation."

The antihistamines antagonize those pharmacological effects of histamine which are mediated through activation of H1- receptor sites and thereby reduce the intensity of allergic reactions and tissue injury response involving histamine release. Antihistamines suppress the histamine-induced wheal (swelling) and flare (vasodilation) response by blocking the binding of histamine to its receptors on nerves, vascular smooth muscle, glandular cells, endothelium, and mast cells.

Xanthine oxidase consists of a molybdenum ion as cofactor in the active center that has different redox states upon substrate binding [L867]. When a substrate such as hypoxanthine or xanthine binds, xanthine oxidase hydroxylates it and molybdenum ion is reduced from hexavalent, Mo(VI), to tetravalent form, Mo(IV). Molybdenum ion is reoxidized into hexavalent state once the hydroxylated substrate, xanthine or uric acid, dissociates from the active site. Topiroxostat is shown to interact with multiple amino acid residues of the solvent channel and additionally forms a reaction intermediate by covalent binding with molybdenum (IV) ion via an oxygen atom [A19657, L867, A19662, A19663]. It also forms hydrogen bonds with molybdenum (VI) ion, suggesting that it has multiple inhibition modes to xanthine oxidase [L867]. Enhanced binding interactions to xanthine oxidase achieves delayed dissociation of topiroxostat from the enzyme. 2-hydroxy-topiroxostat, the metabolite formed by primary hydroxylation of topiroxostat by xanthine oxidase, also causes time and concentration-dependent inhibition of the enzyme [A19656]. 
Topiroxostat is shown to inhibit ATP-binding cassette transporter G2 (ABCG2) in vitro, which is a membrane protein responsible for recovering uric acid in the kidneys and secreting uric acid from the intestines [A19658, A19659]. "

It appears to exert these effects by activating the transient receptor potential ion channel TRPC6. Activation of TRPC6 induces the entry of sodium and calcium into the cell which causes inhibition of monoamine reuptake."

Zenarestat is an aldose reductase inhibitor which inhibits the metabolism of glucose by the polyol pathway, which possibly slows or reduces progression of polyneuropathy. Chronic hyperglycemia affects peripheral nerves by an extracellular mechanism with many types of glycation reactions and chemical rearrangements, and an intracellular route involving increased amounts of glucose passing through the polyol pathway. The polyol pathway allows cells to produce fructose from glucose, and has two steps, which require energy and enzymes. Aldose reductase catalyzes the conversion of glucose to sorbitol in the first step, while the second involves the oxidation of nicotinamide adenine dicnucleotide phosphate (conversion of NADPH to NADP). Chronic hyperglycemia causes damage by overactivity of the polyol pathway, causing a decrease in cellular NADPH levels, reducing the amount of glutathione (a free radical scavenger), and nitric oxide (a vasodilator), as well as increasing cellular sorbital levels, causing decreased levels of myo-inositol (necessary for Na-K ATPase function) and increased fructose, thus increasing AGE (advanced glycosylation end products), the byproduct of the polyol pathway. The suppression of the first step in the polyol pathway by zenarestat prevents these deleterious processes from occuring."

These enzymes catalyze the removal of acetyl groups from the lysine residues of histones proteins. In some cancer cells, there is an overexpression of HDACs, or an aberrant recruitment of HDACs to oncogenic transcription factors causing hypoacetylation of core nucleosomal histones. By inhibiting histone deacetylase, vorinostat causes the accumulation of acetylated histones and induces cell cycle arrest and/or apoptosis of some transformed cells. The mechanism of the antineoplastic effect of vorinostat has not been fully characterized."

The binding of terlipressin to the V2 receptor activates adenylate cyclase which causes the release of aquaporin 2 channels into the cells lining the renal medullar duct. This allows water to be reabsorbed down an osmotic gradient so the urine is more concentrated."

Microtubules are essential to cell division, and epothilones therefore stop cells from properly dividing. Epothilone B possess the same biological effects as taxol both in vitro and in cultured cells. This is because they share the same binding site, as well as binding affinity to the microtubule. Like taxol, epothilone B binds to the αβ-tubulin heterodimer subunit. Once bound, the rate of αβ-tubulin dissociation decreases, thus stabilizing the microtubules. Furthermore, epothilone B has also been shown to induce tubulin polymerization into microtubules without the presence of GTP. This is caused by formation of microtubule bundles throughout the cytoplasm. Finally, epothilone B also causes cell cycle arrest at the G2-M transition phase, thus leading to cytotoxicity and eventually cell apoptosis."

It is a major excitatory receptor in the brain. Normal physiological function requires that the activated receptor fluxes positive ions through the channel part of the receptor. PCP enters the ion channel from the outside of the neuron and binds, reversibly, to a site in the channel pore, blocking the flux of positive ions into the cell. PCP therefore inhibits depolarization of neurons and interferes with cognitive and other functions of the nervous system. [Wikipedia]

This results in an inflammatory reaction and clearing of the adipose tissue remnants by macrophages. Deoxycholic acid's actions are reduced by albumin and tissue-associated proteins, therefore its effect is limited to protein-poor subcutaneous fat tissue. Protein-rich tissues like muscle and skin are unaffected by deoxycholic acid, contributing to its safety profile. "

Lipid mediators resolvin D1 and protectin D1 all inhibit transendothelial migration of neutrophils, so preventing neutrophilic infiltration at sites of inflammation, resolvin D1 inhibits IL-1β production, and protectin D1 inhibits TNF and IL-1β production [A19356]. Monoxydroxy derivative of DHA converted by LOX inhibit thromboxane-induced platelet aggregation. DHA supplementation has also shown to reduce the levels of serum C-reactive protein (CRP) and other circulating markers of inflammation such as neutrophils in hypertriglyceridemic men [A19438]. 
DHA acts as a ligand at peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) gamma and alpha that regulate lipid signalling molecule-mediated transduction pathways and modulate inflammation. 
As a natural ligand, DHA induces a protective effect in retinal tissues by activating retinoid x receptors and subsequent ERK/MAPK signaling pathway in photoreceptors to promote their survival and differentiation, stimulating the expression of antiapoptotic proteins such as Bcl-2 and preserving mitochondrial membrane potential [A19453].

It disrupts the cell permeability of the bacteria by absorbing onto the bacterial cell surface and diffusing across the membrane. It also binds to the cytoplasmic membrane with subsequent formation of complexes and protein precipitation and lyses the membrane in adequate concentrations, perturbing osmotic exchange. Loss of normal enzymatic activity is achieved through several different processes. Denaturation of proteins results in inhibition of bacterial cell metabolism. Disruption of bacterial energy production is mediated through inhibition of glucose metabolism and inhibition of mitochondrial ATP synthesis via inhibition of bacterial F1-ATPase. Protein synthesis is also terminated at the level of ribosomes. Bacterial nucleic acids are also affected through direct binding of the drug to DNA in vitro, and precipitation of cytoplasmic material with nucleic acids being the most sensitive [A19280]. 
The cationic form of dequalinium accumulates in the mitochondria and promotes anticancer activity in human leukemia cells. It mediates a cytotoxic effect by altering redox balance in cells and downregulating Raf/MEK/ERK1/2 and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways in these cells which leads to cell death by apoptosis and/or necrosis [A19290, A19291, A19292]. 
Dequalinium inhibits mycothiol ligase activity in Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains [A19298]."

The mechanism of this action is unclear. Possibilities include serving as an agonist of a nerve growth factor-activated protein kinase (N-Kinase), conversion to cyclic nucleotides that enable advancing nerve endings to overcome the inhibitory effects of myelin, stimulation of differentiation in rat sympathetic neurons, augmentation of nerve growth factor-induced neuritogenesis and promotion of the survival of astrocytes, among others. The mechanism of inosine's possible cardioprotective effect is similarly unclear. Inosine has been reported to have a positive inotropic effect and also to have mild coronary vasodilation activity. Exogenous inosine may contribute to the high-energy phosphate pool of cardiac muscle cells and favorably affect bioenergetics generally. Inosine has also been reported to enhance the myocardial uptake of carbohydrates relative to free fatty acids as well as glycolysis. In cell culture studies, inosine has been found to inhibit the production, in immunostimulated macrophages and spleen cells, of the proinflammatory cytokines, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin (IL)-1, interleukin (IL)-12, macrophage-inflammatory protein-1 alpha and interferon (IFN)-gamma. It also suppressed proinflammatory cytokine production and mortality in a mouse endotoxemic model. These actions might account for the possible immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory and anti-ischemic actions of inosine."

DB04573,Estriol,CHEMBL193482,"Estriol levels can be measured to give an indication of the general health of the fetus. DHEA-S is produced by the adrenal cortex of the fetus. This is converted to estriol by the placenta. If levels of ""unconjugated estriol"" are abnormally low in a pregnant woman, this may indicate a problem with the development of the child. The drug interacts with a target cell receptor. When the estrogen receptor has bound its ligand it can enter the nucleus of the target cell, and regulate gene transcription which leads to formation of messenger RNA. The mRNA interacts with ribosomes to produce specific proteins that express the effect of estriol upon the target cell. Estrogens increase the hepatic synthesis of sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), thyroid-binding globulin (TBG), and other serum proteins and suppress follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) from the anterior pituitary."
DB04574,Estrone sulfate,CHEMBL494753,"Estradiol enters target cells freely (e.g., female organs, breasts, hypothalamus, pituitary) and interacts with a target cell receptor. When the estrogen receptor has bound its ligand it can enter the nucleus of the target cell, and regulate gene transcription which leads to formation of messenger RNA. The mRNA interacts with ribosomes to produce specific proteins that express the effect of estradiol upon the target cell. Estrogens increase the hepatic synthesis of sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), thyroid-binding globulin (TBG), and other serum proteins and suppress follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) from the anterior pituitary."
DB04575,Quinestrol,CHEMBL1201165,"Estrogens diffuse into their target cells and interact with a protein receptor (the estrogen receptor). Estrogen interacts with a target cell receptor. When the estrogen receptor has bound its ligand it can enter the nucleus of the target cell, and regulate gene transcription which leads to formation of messenger RNA. The mRNA interacts with ribosomes to produce specific proteins that express the effect of estradiol upon the target cell. Estrogens increase the hepatic synthesis of sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), thyroid-binding globulin (TBG), and other serum proteins and suppress follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) from the anterior pituitary. Target cells include the female reproductive tract, the mammary gland, the hypothalamus, and the pituitary. Estrogens increase the hepatic synthesis of sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), thyroid-binding globulin (TBG), and other serum proteins and suppress follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) from the anterior pituitary. The combination of an estrogen with a progestin suppresses the hypothalamic-pituitary system, decreasing the secretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH)."

Once inside the terminal it blocks the release of noradrenaline in response to arrival of an action potential. In contrast to ganglionic blocking agents, debrisoquin suppresses equally the responses mediated by alpha-and beta-adrenergic receptors but does not produce parasympathetic blockade. Since sympathetic blockade results in modest decreases in peripheral resistance and cardiac output, debrisoquin lowers blood pressure in the supine position.

By blocking overstimulated receptors and stimulating underactive ones, partial D2 agonists act as dopamine stabilisers. In common with aripiprazole, bifeprunox also acts as a serotonin, 5-HT1A agonist. This property may contribute to efficacy against the negative symptoms of schizophrenia and reduce the likelihood of extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS)."

Allergen exposure is followed by conjunctival mast cell degranulation and histamine released as a result of the formation of complementary IgE cross-links on the conjunctiva. Due to the release of histamine, symptoms such as itching can be observed. Bepotastine works to relieve itchy eyes by three primary mechanisms of action. It is a non-sedating, selective antagonist of the histamine 1 (H1) receptor, a mast cell stabilizer, and it suppresses the migration of eosinophils into inflamed tissues to prevent tissue damage and worsening of allergic inflammation of the conjunctiva.

DB04895,Pegaptanib,,"Pegaptanib sodium is a pegylated aptamer, a modified oligonucleotide, which adopts a three- dimensional conformation that enables it to bind to extracellular VEGF with high affinity and selectivity. Pegaptanib sodium binds to the major pathological VEGF isoform, extracellular VEGF165, with high affinity (Kd = 200 pM) and specificity, thereby inhibiting VEGF165 binding to its VEGF receptors. In contrast virtually no binding of the non-pegylated aptamer to VEGF121 or the VEGF -related proteins VEGF-B, VEGF-C and placental growth factor (PlGF) was detected using invitro filter binding assays. Pegaptanib sodium does not bind significantly to VEGF121. In animal models, VEGF164 (the rodent counterpart of human VEGF165) was specifically upregulated in disease. The selective inhibition of VEGF164 with pegaptanib sodium proved as effective at suppressing pathological neovascularization as pan-VEGF inhibition7, however pegaptanib sodium spared the normal vasculature whereas pan-VEGF inhibition did not."

Nesiritide has been shown to relax isolated human arterial and venous tissue preparations that were precontracted with either endothelin-1 or the alpha-adrenergic agonist, phenylephrine. In human studies, nesiritide produced dose-dependent reductions in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) and systemic arterial pressure in patients with heart failure. In animals, nesiritide had no effects on cardiac contractility or on measures of cardiac electrophysiology such as atrial and ventricular effective refractory times or atrioventricular node conduction. Naturally occurring atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), a related peptide, increases vascular permeability in animals and humans and may reduce intravascular volume. The effect of nesiritide on vascular permeability has not been studied.

DB04900,Thymalfasin,CHEMBL2103979,"The mechanism of action of thymalfasin is not completely understood but is thought to be related to its immunomodulating activities, centered primarily around augmentation of T-cell function. In various in vitro assays, thymosin alpha 1 has been shown to promote T-cell differentiation and maturation; for example, CD4+, CD8+, and CD3+ cells have all been shown to be increased. Thymosin alpha 1 has also been shown to increase production of IFN-g, IL-2, IL-3, and expression of IL-2 receptor following activation by mitogens or antigens, increase NK cell activity, increase production of migratory inhibitory factor (MIF), and increase antibody response to T-cell dependent antigens. Thymosin alpha 1 has also been shown to antagonize dexamethasone-induced apoptosis of thymocytes in vitro. In vivo administration of thymosin alpha 1 to animals immunosuppressed by chemotherapy, tumor burden, or irradiation showed that thymosin alpha 1 protects against cytotoxic damage to bone marrow, tumor progression and opportunistic infections, thereby increasing survival time and number of survivors. Many of the in vitro and in vivo effects of thymosin alpha 1 have been interpreted as influences on either differentiation of pluripotent stem cells to thymocytes or activation of thymocytes into activated T-cells. Thymalfasin also has been shown in vitro to upregulate expression of toll like receptors (TLR) including TLR2 and TLR9 in mouse and human dendritic cells, as well as activate NF-kB and JNK/P38/AP1 pathways. Thymalfasin's activation of dendritic cells provides another possible pathway explaining thymalfasin's immunomodulatory and antiviral effects. "

DB04904,Amolimogene,,"Amolimogene particles are injected into the leg muscle and encounter cells known as antigen presenting cells, which play a pivotal role in activating the immune system. Once inside the dendritic cells, amolimogene dissolves and the genetic information that codes for parts of the HPV virus is released. The information is then processed, attaches to a protein and transported to the surface of the dendritic cell, attracting immune cells known as T cells. The T cells attach to the protein holding the information and begin to divide, creating many HPV targeted T cells. These cells migrate to the cervix where they encounter HPV expressing cells. Once inside the cervix, the T cells surround and eliminate the abnormal precancerous cells that cause cervical dysplasia. The result can be normal, healthy tissue."
DB04905,Tesmilifene,CHEMBL26424,"Although the exact mechanism of action is not known, one study (PMID: 16413681) proposes that tesmilifene may be an activating p-gp substrate, which enables the p-gp pump to extrude typical p-gp substrates (such as anthracyclines or taxanes) more efficiently. This process consumes ATP, since the p-gp is absolutely, and highly dependent on ATP hydrolysis. The mechanism of cell death is likely to result not from the presence of chemotherapy inside the cell (in fact the chemotherapy is extruded) but, directly or indirectly, from the enhanced consumption of ATP. The ATP may be consumed below a threshold necessary for survival, or, (more likely) the enhanced ATP production required to maintain ATP levels may result in the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) to an extent that overwhelms the cell’s ability to inactivate them. The result would be additional cell death, but only in the mdr+ population. The doxorubicin would continue to act on the drug sensitive remainder of the cell population, but without the help of tesmilifene."

In vivo, flibanserin binds equally to 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptors. However, under higher levels of brain 5-HT (i.e., under stress), flibanserin may occupy 5-HT2A receptors in higher proportion than 5-HT(1A) receptors. It may also moderately antagonize D4 (dopamine) receptors and 5-HT2B and 5-HTB2C. Its action on neurotransmitter receptors may contribute to reduction in serotonin levels and increase in dopamine and norepinephrine levels, all of which may play part in reward processing. "
DB04909,Sitamaquine,CHEMBL57004,"The mechanism of plasmodicidal action of sitamaquine is not completely understood. Like other quinoline derivatives, it is thought to inhibit heme polymerase activity. This results in accumulation of free heme, which is toxic to the parasites."
DB04910,Oxibendazole,CHEMBL1087630,"Oxibendazole causes degenerative alterations in the tegument and intestinal cells of the worm by binding to the colchicine-sensitive site of tubulin, thus inhibiting its polymerization or assembly into microtubules. The loss of the cytoplasmic microtubules leads to impaired uptake of glucose by the larval and adult stages of the susceptible parasites, and depletes their glycogen stores. Degenerative changes in the endoplasmic reticulum, the mitochondria of the germinal layer, and the subsequent release of lysosomes result in decreased production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is the energy required for the survival of the helminth. Due to diminished energy production, the parasite is immobilized and eventually dies."

Cephalosporins disrupt the synthesis of the peptidoglycan layer of bacterial cell walls. The peptidoglycan layer is important for cell wall structural integrity, especially in Gram-positive organisms. The final transpeptidation step in the synthesis of the peptidoglycan is facilitated by transpeptidases known as penicillin binding proteins (PBPs). PBPs bind to the D-Ala-D-Ala at the end of muropeptides (peptidoglycan precursors) to crosslink the peptidoglycan. Beta-lactam antibiotics mimic this site and competitively inhibit PBP crosslinking of peptidoglycan."
DB04919,Alfimeprase,,"When delivered locally at the site of a blood clot, alfimeprase has the potential, through a unique mechanism of action, to directly and rapidly degrade fibrin, a protein that provides the scaffolding for blood clots.

DB04921,Dirucotide,,The apparent mechanism of action of MBP8298 is the induction or restoration of immunological tolerance with respect to ongoing immune attack at this molecular site. High doses of antigen delivered periodically by the intravenous route are expected to suppress immune responses to the administered substance. The potential benefit of MBP8298 for any individual patient is therefore expected to be related to the extent to which his or her disease process is dominated by autoimmune attack at the site represented by this synthetic peptide.
DB04924,Itopride,CHEMBL2107457,"Itopride has anticholinesterase (AchE) activity as well as dopamine D2 receptor antagonistic activity. It is well established that M3 receptors exist on the smooth muscle layer throughout the gut and acetylcholine (ACh) released from enteric nerve endings stimulates the contraction of smooth muscle through M3 receptors. The enzyme AChE hydrolyses the released ACh, inactivates it and thus inhibits the gastric motility leading to various digestive disorders. Besides ACh, dopamine is present in significant amounts in the gastrointestinal tract and has several inhibitory effects on gastrointestinal motility, including reduction of lower esophageal sphincter and intragastric pressure. These effects appear to result from suppression of ACh release from the myenteric motor neurons and are mediated by the D2 subtype of dopamine receptors. Itopride, by virtue of its dopamine D2 receptor antagonism, removes the inhibitory effects on Ach release. It also inhibits the enzyme AchE which prevents the degradation of ACh. The net effect is an increase in ACh concentration, which in turn, promotes gastric motility, increases the lower esophageal sphincter pressure, accelerates gastric emptying and improves gastro-duodenal coordination. This dual mode of action of Itopride is unique and different from the actions of other prokinetic agents available in the market.

DB04949,Pexelizumab,,"Although inflammation is a normal response, continued exposure to foreign surfaces, toxic antigens, and tissue injury results in pathologic local and systemic inflammation (SIRS). This response involves multiple humoral and cellular components, including the coagulation (Factor XII, thrombin, Proteins C and S, platelets) and complement systems, cytokines (TNF-alpha, interleukins), leukocytes, monocytes, adhesion molecules (ICAM-1), and endothelial cells, among others. The complement system is a group of glycoproteins, which, when activated, results in the formation of C3-convertase, which converts C3 to C3a and C3b. C3a cleaves C5 to C5a and C5b. C5b, in conjunction with C6, C7, C8, and C9, forms the membrane attack or terminal complement complex (TCC) C5b-9. Both C5a and C5b-9 activate, promote, and amplify inflammatory components, and likely play central roles in the development of SIRS, tissue injury, reperfusion injury, and apoptosis.

DB04953,Ezogabine,CHEMBL41355,"Ezogabine has a novel mechanism of action that involves opening of neuronal Kv7.2-7.5 (formerly KCNQ2-5) voltage activated potassium channels. These channels (primarily Kv7.2/7.3) enable generation of the M-current, a sub-threshold potassium current that serves to stabilize the membrane potential and control neuronal excitability. In addition to acting on potassium ion channels, retigabine also affects GABA neurotransmission in the GABA-A receptor, which is a key inhibitory receptor in the central nervous system and is implicated in epilepsy. Malfunctioning of the GABA-A receptor leads to hyperexcitability in the brain, which causes seizures, making this receptor an important target for antiepileptic therapeutics. Apart from increasing the concentration of GABA in the brain (by either enhancing GABA synthesis or blocking GABA metabolism), retigabine allosterically potentiates GABA-induced current in rat cortical neurons in a concentration-dependent manner. Numerous studies have demonstrated that retigabine is effective in a broad spectrum of in vivo epilepsy and seizure models."

This helps to inflate and expand the air sacs during breathing and prevents their collapse. Surfactants are normally produced naturally in the lungs. A failure by the lungs to do this results in a life threatening disorder known as respiratory distress syndrome, where the lungs become stiff, uninflatable and make breathing extremely difficult. This commonly occurs in premature babies, where their under-developed lungs are incapable of producing surfactants. Pumactant is given directly into the lung through a tube (endotracheal administration), to replace the natural surfactant and therefore aids breathing in premature babies."

After translation, RAS goes through four steps of modification: isoprenylation, proteolysis, methylation and palmitoylation. Isoprenylation involves the enzyme farnesyltransferase (FTase) transferring a farnesyl group from farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) to the pre-RAS protein. Also, a related enzyme geranylgeranyltransferase I (GGTase I) has the ability to transfer a geranylgeranyl group to K and N-RAS. Farnesyl is necessary to attach RAS to the cell membrane.

As a result of this genetic modification, the HSVs are able to reproduce in tumor cells solely, since only these offer an environment that compensates for the loss of the removed viral genes. Consequently, the virus is able to replicate in the tumor cells, selectively destroying them without harming healthy tissue."
DB04970,Lesopitron,CHEMBL2105051,Lesopitron acts as a ligand for central serotonin 5-HT1A receptors. Lesopitron inhibits haloperidol-induced catalepsy that is the consequence of its action on 5-HT1A autoreceptors. The ability of lesopitron to induce 5-HT syndrome reflects post-synaptic 5-HT1A receptor activation and the reversion of 8-OHDPAT-induced 5-HT syndrome by lesopitron suggests a partial agonist effect on this receptor-type. Lesopitron induced a hypothermic effect due to the enhanced activation of post-synaptic 5-HT1A receptors. The agonist effect of lesopitron on 5-HT1A receptors and its marked hypothermic effect is an added value for this drug and a stimulus to the study of its possible neuroprotective action.

DB04972,Canfosfamide,CHEMBL2111086,"S-transferase P1-1 (GST P1-1) is an enzyme overexpressed in many human cancer cells. High levels of GST P1-1 are associated with a poor prognosis and resistance to certain chemotherapeutics. The activation of canfosfamide occurs when GST P1-1 splits canfosfamide into two active fragments: a glutathione analog fragment and an active cytotoxic fragment. The cytotoxic fragment reacts with important cell components, including RNA, DNA and proteins, leading to cell death. The glutathione analog fragment of canfosfamide may remain bound to GST P1-1, which may limit the ability of GST P1-1 to inactivate other cancer drugs. "

DB04998,AGRO100,,"AGRO100, an experimental anticancer drug that recently entered human clinical trials, is a member of a novel class of antiproliferative agents known as G-rich oligonucleotides (GRO), which are non-antisense, guanosine-rich phosphodiester oligodeoxynucleotides that form stable G-quadruplex structures. The biological activity of GROs results from their binding to specific cellular proteins as aptamers. One important target protein of GROs has been previously identified as nucleolin, a multifunctional protein expressed at high levels by cancer cells. AGRO100 also associates with nuclear factor-{kappa}B (NF-{kappa}B) essential modulator (NEMO), which is a regulatory subunit of the inhibitor of {kappa}B (I{kappa}B) kinase (IKK) complex, and also called IKK{gamma}. In the classic NF-{kappa}B pathway, the IKK complex is required for phosphorylation of I{kappa}B{alpha} and subsequent activation of the transcription factor NF-{kappa}B. Research shows that treatment of cancer cells with AGRO100 inhibits IKK activity and reduces phosphorylation of I{kappa}B{alpha} in response to tumor necrosis factor-{alpha} stimulation. It also shows that AGRO100 blocks both tumor necrosis factor-{alpha}-induced and constitutive NF-{kappa}B activity in human cancer cell lines derived from cervical, prostate, breast, and lung carcinomas. In addition, in AGRO100-treated cancer cells, NEMO is coprecipitated by nucleolin, indicating that both proteins are present in the same complex. Studies suggest that abrogation of NF-{kappa}B activity may contribute to the anticancer effects of AGRO100 and that nucleolin may play a previously unknown role in regulating the NF-{kappa}B pathway.

GLP-1 plays an important role in regulating meal-related blood glucose by increasing the amount of insulin secreted in response to meals. PSN9301 increases GLP-1 activity and causes significant lowering of blood glucose levels. The increase in insulin secretion in response to GLP-1 is glucose-dependent, providing a built in safety mechanism against low blood glucose levels (hypoglycaemia) in response to treatment with DP-IV inhibitors."
DB05003,Imexon,CHEMBL146428,"Imexon enters the cell and binds to glutathione and other sulfhydryl compounds, effectively preventing them from scavenging the toxic free radicals. So, particularly in the rapidly dividing cancer cell, free radical build-up in the presence of imexon leads to changes in mitochondrial membrane potential and ultimately to the mitochondria swelling and bursting. Mitochondrial proteins, in particular cytochrome c, are released into the cytoplasm and this activates caspase-mediated apoptosis resulting in cancer cell death. This sequence of events has been well characterized and published in several papers in leading cancer journals. Imexon is probably the only cancer drug under development at this time which exploits this mechanism of action.
Imexon is an inhibitor of ribonucleotide reductase, a key enzyme in DNA synthesis that is also a target for gemcitabine. Imexon is also a cell cycle inhibitor and in the presence of the drug cells accumulate in S phase."

Overexpression of EpCAM has been shown to promote the proliferation, migration and invasiveness of breast cancer cells. Moreover, expression of EpCAM is associated with decreased survival in a number of cancer indications, including breast, gall bladder, bile duct, ovarian and ampullary pancreatic cancer. EpCAM has recently been shown to be expressed on cancer stem cells from breast, prostate, colon and pancreatic cancer.

DB05011,EG004,,"EG004 is a combination of a vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF-D) gene packaged in an adenoviral vector (Ad 5) and a bio-degradable local drug delivery device made from collagen and invented by Ark. At the end of access graft surgery, the delivery device is fitted around the outside of the patient's vein where it has been joined to the access graft. The adenoviral vector carrying the VEGF gene is then injected into a space between the device and the blood vessel. This unique administration of the gene to the outside of the blood vessel rather than into the blood supply localises delivery of the gene to the target tissue site (smooth muscle cells) and reduces the risk of unwanted systemic effects. Once the VEGF gene is transfected locally, muscle cells in the vessel wall produce the VEGF protein which triggers the release of beneficial nitric oxide and prostacyclin. Ark has made a novel discovery by showing that the VEGF protein working via these two agents has a protective effect in vivo, keeping blood vessel walls in a healthy state and regulating muscle cell growth to prevent blocking of the vessel."

DB05016,Ataluren,CHEMBL256997,"Ataluren enables ribosomal readthrough of mRNA containing premature stop codons that otherwise would result in premature termination of protein chains. Use of ataluren allows cellular machinery to bypass nonsense mutations in genetic material, continue the translation process, and thereby restore the production of a full-length, functional protein.

The research on the effects of Ataluren on the translation and stability of nonsense-containing mRNA in vitor show that Ataluren promoted readthrough at each of the nonsense codons, showing maximal activity with UGA, while having no effect on mRNA levels. Unlike the stable cell line assays, Ataluren did not discriminate significantly between the UAG and UAA mRNAs. Ataluren was a more potent nonsense-suppressing agent than gentamicin, and exhibited 4- to 15-fold stimulation of in vitro readthrough relative to the controls at levels similar to those in the stable cell reporter assays. These results indicate that Ataluren modulates termination efficiency at premature nonsense codons."

DB05024,CTA018,,"CTA018 is a rationally designed Vitamin D hormone analog that acts as both a potent VDR agonist and CYP24 inhibitor. The Company believes this dual mechanism of action will provide efficacy and safety advantages over existing Vitamin D hormone replacement therapies for SHPT. CTA018 binds to the VDR located in parathyroid cells and triggers a genomic cascade of events resulting in suppression of PTH secretion. It also binds to the substrate binding pocket of CYP24, a cytochrome P450 enzyme that specifically and efficiently catabolizes Vitamin D hormones. By binding to CYP24 and blocking its activity, CTA018 levels in cells are more readily raised to therapeutic levels. Unlike common cytochrome P450 inhibitors (such as ketoconazole) which act non-specifically on all cytochromes, CTA018 specifically targets CYP24, making drug-drug interactions far less likely. The Company believes the novel dual activity of CTA018 will reduce the incidence of clinically-acquired resistance to Vitamin D hormone replacement therapy, allowing greatly improved efficacy at well tolerated dosages."

DB05032,REV131,,"rEV131 is smaller than therapeutic antibodies and its compact structure gives good bioavailablity by a number of routes including: injected, inhaled, intraperitoneal, topical (ocular and nasal). The molecule is thermo-stable and can be stored in solution for more than 18 months at room temperature without significant loss of activity. This is an attractive feature for a protein drug candidate.

rEV131 is a novel histamine binding protein that modulates the immediate inflammatory response largely caused by the release of pre-formed histamine from mast cells in the skin. This molecule binds histamine at two active sites, one of which has an affinity for histamine 10 - 100 times higher than any known histamine receptor. This enables rEV131 to out compete the body's natural receptors and prevent histamine from reaching and activating them.

There are at least four different natural histamine receptors. The most recently discovered H4 receptor, was described in 2001, and appears to be involved in the late phase inflammatory process. rEV131 is understood to be the only drug candidate in clinical development, which prevents activation of the H4 receptor.

rEV131 has demonstrated activity against both early and late phase inflammation in clinical and preclinical studies. This differentiates it from approved treatments: anti-histamines used in early phase inflammation and corticosteroid therapies, which are used predominantly in late phase inflammation. A favourable safety profile and a variety of delivery routes provide additional potential advantages for rEV131 over existing therapies."

DB05039,Indacaterol,CHEMBL1095777,"Indacaterol works by stimulating adrenergic beta-2 receptors in the smooth muscle of the airways. This causes relaxation of the muscle, thereby increasing the diameter of the airways, which become constricted in asthma and COPD. It is also long acting due to its high affinity to the lipid raft domains in the airway membrane so it slowly dissociates from the receptors. Indacaterol also has a high intrinsic efficacy so it is also very rapid acting - onset of action occurs within 5 minutes. 

The pharmacological effects of beta2-adrenoceptor agonist drugs, including indacaterol, are at least in part attributable to stimulation of intracellular adenyl cyclase, the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to cyclic-3’, 5’-adenosine monophosphate (cyclic monophosphate). Increased cyclic AMP levels cause relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle. In vitro studies have shown that indacaterol has more than 24-fold greater agonist activity at beta2-receptors compared to beta1-receptors and 20-fold greater agonist activity compared to beta3-receptors. This selectivity profile is similar to formoterol. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown."

Buprenorphine is also a kappa-opioid receptor antagonist. The partial agonist activity means that opioid receptor antagonists (e.g., an antidote such as naloxone) only partially reverse the effects of buprenorphine. The binding to the mu and kappa receptors results in hyperpolarization and reduced neuronal excitability."
DB05047,CX717,,"CX717 is an ampakine compound. It is a positive allosteric modulator of AMPA receptors. It's action is theorized to be due to facilitation of transmission at cortical synapses that use glutamate as neurotransmitter. This in turn may promote plasticity at the synapse, which could translate into better cognitive performance.
CX717 works by allosterically binding to particular receptors in the brain, called AMPA-type glutamate receptors. This boosts the activity of glutamate, a neurotransmitter, and makes it easier to encode memory and to learn. In addition, CX717 could potentially strongly impact the up-regulation of BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor) or NGF (nerve growth factor), two growth factors known to stimulate formation of new circuitry in the brain associated with forming memory and cognition."

Fluorescence resonance energy transfer and protease digestion studies showed that MF101 produces a different conformation in ERalpha from ERbeta, when compared with the conformations produced by estradiol. The specific conformational change induced by MF101 allows ERbeta to bind to an ERE and recruit coregulatory proteins that are required for gene activation.

Erdosteine modulates mucus production and viscosity and increases mucociliary transport, thereby improving expectoration. It also exhibits inhibitory activity against the effects of free radicals produced by cigarette smoke. Clinical studies in patients with chronic obstructive lung disease have demonstrated the efficacy and tolerability of erdosteine. Erdosteine 300mg twice daily reduced cough (both frequency and severity) and sputum viscosity more quickly and more effectively than placebo and reduced the adhesivity of sputum more effectively than ambroxol 30mg twice daily. Co-administration of erdosteine and amoxicillin in patients with acute infective exacerbation of chronic bronchitis resulted in higher concentrations of the antibiotic in the sputum, leading to earlier and more pronounced amelioration of clinical symptoms compared with placebo.

DB05072,AV608,," An extensive body of scientific literature supports the potential therapeutic application of NK-1 antagonists to the treatment of anxiety disorders. At a biological level, there is a close anatomical association between Substance P, NK-1 receptors and monoamines. More specifically, ~50% of ascending serotonin neurons in the brain also co-express substance P, and norepinephrine cell bodies in the locus coeruleus express NK-1 receptors. In addition, it has been demonstrated that NK-1 receptor blockade can alter the firing pattern of both serotonin and norepinephrine neurons and increase hippocampal neurogenesis. At a functional level, NK-1 antagonists (including AV608) have broadly demonstrated activity in nearly all of the traditionally used preclinical assays to identify anxiolytic agents, including those assays that are predictive for both benzodiazepines and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Clinically, anxiety remains a high priority target for Industry, as evidenced by recent development activity in this area.
 It is known that the human intestinal mucosa expresses NK-1 receptors. These receptors are also found in the smooth muscle, arterioles, venules and cells associated with lymph nodules and co-localized with substance P, which is found throughout the gastrointestinal tract. Nerve fibers, including sensory fibers, come into close contact with mast cells, which also express NK-1 receptors. Furthermore, approximately 80% of visceral sensory afferents in the gut express substance P, and it is known that NK-1 receptors in the spinal cord mediate visceral hyperalgesia. Tachykinins are potent secretagogues at the small and large intestinal mucosa in several animal models as well as in the human colon, where there is a direct NK-1 receptor mediated response. Perhaps most important with respect to IBS is the observation that stimulation of sensory fibers or mast cells in the human intestinal tract causes the release of substance P and a consequent increase in epithelial ion transport through the activation of NK-1 receptors. The response to colorectal distension has often been used as a proxy for IBS. In this model, colorectal distension increases abdominal flinching, which is an indicator of pain. This procedure also activates a rectocolonic inhibitory reflex characterized by a decrease in colonic pressure and an increase in fluid transport. Several authors have now observed that NK-1 receptors mediate this rectocolonic inhibitory reflex. Decreased colonic pressure is related to increased colonic transit and these findings are therefore consistent with reports that stress increases intestinal transit, an effect blocked by NK-1 receptor antagonists.
Overactive bladder is a common and distressing condition that has a profound effect on the daily living of affected individuals. This common cause of urinary incontinence describes a cluster of symptoms typified by urinary urgency, frequency, and urge urinary incontinence. Whereas the currently available anticholinergic drugs used to treat overactive bladder act on efferent nerves to counteract overactive bladder, essentially after it occurs, NK-1 antagonists appear to have promising therapeutic potential in their ability to affect the afferent nerves that modulate bladder contraction. A key potential advantage of NK-1 antagonists is that there may be essentially no decrement of detrusor contractility and no urinary retention risk, as is seen with current anticholinergic agents. This is because NK-1 antagonists inhibit sensory afferent nerves but not efferent nerves, which are important for normal and complete voiding of urine. Furthermore, NK-1 antagonists have a more favorable tolerability profile than observed with anticholinergic medications."

DB05098,Leptin,,"It is unknown whether leptin can cross the blood-brain barrier to access receptor neurons, because the blood-brain barrier is somewhat absent in the area of the median eminence, close to where the NPY neurons of the arcuate nucleus are. If it does cross the blood-brain barrier, it is unknown whether this occurs via an active or passive process. It is generally thought that leptin might enter the brain at the choroid plexus, where there is intense expression of a form of leptin receptor molecule that might act as a transport mechanism.

Once leptin has bound to the Ob-Rb receptor, it activates the molecule stat3, which is phosphorylated and travels to the nucleus, it is presumed, to effect changes in gene expression. One of the main effects on gene expression is the down-regulation of the expression of endocannabinoids, responsible—among their many other functions—for increasing appetite. There are other intracellular pathways activated by leptin, but less is known about how they function in this system. In response to leptin, receptor neurons have been shown to remodel themselves, changing the number and types of synapses that fire onto them.

Although leptin is a circulating signal that reduces appetite, in general, obese people have an unusually high circulating concentration of leptin.[3] These people are said to be resistant to the effects of leptin, in much the same way that people with type 2 diabetes are resistant to the effects of insulin. Thus, obesity develops when people take in more energy than they use over a prolonged period of time, and this excess food intake is not driven by hunger signals, occurring in spite of the anti-appetite signals from circulating leptin. The high sustained concentrations of leptin from the enlarged fat stores result in the cells that respond to leptin becoming desensitized.

In mice, leptin is also required for male and female fertility. In mammals generally, and in humans in particular, puberty in females is linked to a critical level of body fat. When fat levels fall below this threshold (as in anorexia), the ovarian cycle stops and females stop menstruating.

Leptin is also strongly linked with angiogenesis, increasing VEGF levels."
DB05099,Ancrod,,"Ancrod's anticoagulant effects are through the rapid removal of fibrinogen from the blood within hours following ancrod administration. Ancrod specifically cleaves only the alpha chain of fibrinogen, producing the characteristic fibrinopeptides A, AP and AY, not the B-fibrinopeptide. The resulting fibrin polymers are imperfectly formed and much smaller in size (1 to 2 µm long) than the fibrin polymers produced by the action of thrombin. These ancrod-induced microthrombi are friable, unstable, urea-soluble and have significantly degraded a-chains. They do not cross-link to form thrombi. They are markedly susceptible to digestion by plasmin and are rapidly removed from circulation by either reticuloendothelial phagocytosis or normal fibrinolysis, or both. The blood viscosity in patients receiving ancrod is progressively reduced by 30 to 40%.
Ancrod does not activate plagminogen and does not degrade preformed, fully cross-linked thrombin fibrin. Consequently, unlike fibrinolytic agents, ancrod can be used postoperatively. 
Unlike thrombin, ancrod does not directly activate Factor XIII, nor does it produce platelet aggregation nor cause the release of ADP, ATP, potassium, nor serotonin from platelets.

DB05112,AP5280,,"
AP5280 was designed to take advantage of two independent mechanisms for attaining selectivity. The first of these is the enhanced permeability and retention effect by which high molecular weight polymers passively accumulate to high levels in tumors, and the second is the increased level of expression of proteases capable of cleaving the peptide linker between the polymer and the cytotoxic moiety that is characteristic of many tumors.
AP5280 is a chemotherapeutic agent that we believe has the potential to have significantly superior effectiveness in treating numerous cancers compared to platinum compounds currently in use. AP5280 seeks to achieve this goal by attaching a large polymer to a small platinum molecule. This method exploits the usually leaky or hyperpermeable nature of the cells that line the walls of blood vessels that
feed tumors by allowing the large AP5280 molecule to enter the tumor in preference to other tissue, which do not have leaky or hyperpermeable blood vessels. In addition, the capillary/lymphatic drainage system of tumors is not well developed and limited, so the drug gets trapped in the
tumor. This dual effect is called enhanced permeability and retention, or EPR. In addition, the polymer is designed to shield the platinum from interactions with normal cells while the drug circulates within the body, thereby reducing toxicity. The proposed mechanism of how AP5280 is taken up by tumor cells bypasses known membrane-associated mechanisms
for development of tumor resistance, a common cause of failure of chemo-therapeutic drugs over the course of treatment.

Because in healthy cells the phospholipids are concealed inside the cell, the bavituximab does not bind to them. This targets the bavituximab to the malignant cells and potentially minimizes unwanted side effects. 

Bavituximab Anti-Viral represents a unique approach to treating viral diseases by recognizing features found only on infected cells and enveloped viruses. Bavituximab is a monoclonal antibody that binds to a basic component of the cell structure called an aminophospholipid that is exposed on the surface of cells only when they are infected with certain viruses or when they are malignant. After binding to these infected cells, the drug alerts the body’s immune system to attack the infected cells. This makes infected cells particularly susceptible to bavituximab treatment, while potentially sparing healthy cells. Also, bavituximab binds to phospholipids which are derived from the host (human) cell and not the virus, which indicates it may not be susceptible to viral drug resistance. In addition to treating an active illness, bavituximab may also confer long-term immunity. Bavituximab induces a pro-inflammatory cytokine profile, defined as an increase in the ratio of TNF alpha and TGF beta. Stimulating an immune response is a key proposed anti-viral mechanism of action of bavituximab.

However, lobeline does not release dopamine from its presynaptic terminal, but appears to induce the metabolism of dopamine intraneuronally. Reevaluation of the mechanism by which lobeline alters dopamine function reveals that its primary mechanism is inhibition of dopamine uptake and promotion of dopamine release from the storage vesicles within the presynaptic terminal, via an interaction with the tetrabenazine-binding site on the vesicular monoamine transporter (VMAT2). Thus, lobeline appears to perturb the fundamental mechanisms of dopamine storage and release. Based on its neurochemical mechanism, the ability of lobeline to functionally antagonize the neurochemical and behavioral effects of the psychostimulants amphetamine and methamphetamine was examined.

Mitochondria are central mediators of cell death and are implicated in most if not all neurodegenerative diseases regardless of the initiating factor: genetic mutations,

In neurons, especially near synaptic sites, mitochondria are essential calcium-buffering organelles in areas where membrane excitability leads to large influx of calcium through calcium channels. Mitochondria also produce the ATP necessary for microtubule-based axoplasmic transport and maintaining the activity of ion and nutrient transporters. If a neuron fails to establish or maintain its functional role, mitochondria are responsible for eliminating it

Silver sulfadiazine acts only on the cell membrane and cell wall to produce its bactericidal effect. A specific mechanism of action has not been determined, but silver sulfadiazine's effectiveness may possibly be from a synergistic interaction, or the action of each component. Silver is a biocide, which binds to a broad range of targets. Silver ions bind to nucleophilic amino acids, as well as sulfhydryl, amino, imidazole, phosphate, and carboxyl groups in proteins, causing protein denaturation and enzyme inhibition. 
Silver binds to surface membranes and proteins, causing proton leaks in the membrane, leading to cell death.

Voltage-sensitive calcium channels (VSCC) mediate the entry of calcium ions into excitable cells and are also involved in a variety of calcium-dependent processes, including muscle contraction, hormone or neurotransmitter release, gene expression, cell motility, cell division and cell death. The isoform alpha-1G gives rise to T-type calcium currents. T-type calcium channels belong to the ""low-voltage activated (LVA)"" group and are strongly blocked by mibefradil. A particularity of this type of channels is an opening at quite negative potentials and a voltage-dependent inactivation. T-type channels serve pacemaking functions in both central neurons and cardiac nodal cells and support calcium signaling in secretory cells and vascular smooth muscle. They may also be involved in the modulation of firing patterns of neurons which is important for information processing as well as in cell growth processes."

These newly formed vessels provide alternate routes of blood flow and oxygen delivery to parts of the patient’s heart downstream from a blockage in a coronary artery. In many patients however, including those with recurrent angina, coronary collateral vessel formation is insufficient to meet the heart’s needs during stress. Currently available anti-anginal drugs, which may provide symptomatic relief, are generally designed to alter the oxygen demand of the heart muscle or dilate vessels to temporarily relieve angina.

Increased capillary permeability accompanies capillary dilatation, producing an outward passage of plasma protein and fluid into the extracellular spaces, an increase in lymph flow and protein content, and the formation of edema. In addition, histamine has a direct stimulant action on smooth muscle, producing contraction if H 1-receptors are activated, or mostly relaxation if H 2-receptors are activated. Also in humans, the stimulant effect of histamine may cause contraction of the intestinal muscle. However, little effect is noticed on the uterus, bladder, or gallbladder.

DB05485,ADH-1,,"While ADH-1 has a single molecular target, N-cadherin, we believe its anti-cancer effect results from two distinct mechanisms of action - apoptosis and tumor vessel angiolysis.

N-cadherin appears to act as a tumor cell survival factor. In cell culture studies, inhibition of N-cadherin binding between tumor cells has been shown to cause apoptosis of tumor cells, we believe as a result of disrupting the cadherin-regulated cell survival signals.

ADH-1 also appears to disrupt the blood vessels needed for cancerous tumors to grow and flourish, with hemorrhaging having been noted in both our clinical and preclinical studies. We believe the mechanism for this disruption is either a competitive inhibition of the binding of cadherins between the endothelial cells of the tumor blood wall or apoptosis in tumor cells that form a part of the blood vessel wall, each leading to leakage and rupture of these vessels. The latter involves the phenomenon of tumor ""mosaicism,"" in which tumor cells form a portion of the vascular wall (along with the endothelial cells). Induction of cell death of these tumor cells would result in tumor vascular disruption.

The process of HIV entry begins with binding of the viral envelope glycoprotein to both the CD4 receptor and one of only two chemokine receptors, and ends with fusion of viral and cell membranes. Viral entry provides novel therapeutic targets against HIV. To date, at least 3 sub classes of HIV viral entry/fusion inhibitors have emerged:

   1. CD4 binding or attachment - targets initial recognition and binding of the viral glycoprotein gp120 to the cell-surface CD4 antigen.
   2. Chemokine co-receptor binding - targets binding of virus to the CCR5 or CXCR4 co-receptor.
   3. Fusion Inhibition - targets the viral glycoprotein gp41 inhibiting the fusion of virus with the cell.

DB05502,AG-858,,"Under normal conditions, heat shock proteins are not found outside the cell. But if a cancerous or infected cell has become so sick that it dies and its membrane bursts, all of the cell’s contents spill out, including heat shock proteins that are bound to peptides. These extracellular HSPs send a very strong ‘dange r signal’ to the immune system, instructing it to destroy the other diseased cells. This is how it works:

    * A sick cell dies and ruptures, spilling out the HSP-peptide complexes.
    * These extracellular complexes of HSPs and peptides are detected by circulating immune system cells called antigen-presenting cells (APCs). These APCs include cells called macrophages and dendritic cells.
    * The HSP complexes bind the CD91 receptor on the APC cell surface. The APC can then take in the HSP complexes.
    * Once the APCs have taken in the HSP complexes, they travel to the lymph nodes, which are clusters of immune system tissue that are distributed throughout the body.
    * In the lymph nodes, the APCs take the peptides that were associated with the HSPs and re-present them on the APC cell surface. These peptides are antigenic — meaning that they can stimulate an immune response.
    * In the lymph nodes, specialized immune cells called T cells ‘see’ these peptides and are then programmed to seek out cells bearing these specific, abnormal peptides.
    * Because every person and every cancer is different, the unique repertoire of antigenic peptides represents that individual patient’s specific cancer’s ‘fingerprint.’ The T cells are activated to target and destroy cancer cells bearing this fingerprint."

DB05688,CRx-119,,"Amoxapine acts by decreasing the reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin (5-HT). Glucocorticoids such as prednisolone can inhibit leukocyte infiltration at the site of inflammation, interfere with mediators of inflammatory response, and suppress humoral immune responses. The antiinflammatory actions of glucocorticoids are thought to involve phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins, lipocortins, which control the biosynthesis of potent mediators of inflammation such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes. Prednisolone reduces inflammatory reaction by limiting the capillary dilatation and permeability of the vascular structures. These compounds restrict the accumulation of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and macrophages and reduce the release of vasoactive kinins. Recent research suggests that corticosteroids may inhibit the release of arachidonic acid from phospholipids, thereby reducing the formation of prostaglandins. Prednisolone is a glucocorticoid receptor agonist. On binding, the corticoreceptor-ligand complex translocates itself into the cell nucleus, where it binds to many glucocorticoid response elements (GRE) in the promoter region of the target genes.

The triggering of the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway is observed within the first six hours of applying elesclomol. Cancer cells operate at a much higher intrinsic level of ROS than normal cells, and have a greatly reduced anti-oxidant capacity compared to normal cells. This leaves them more vulnerable to an agent such as elesclomol that elevates oxidative stress. In similar experiments at similar doses, elesclomol has been found to have little to no impact on normal cells."

In UC patients the mucosal surface of the colon wall is characterized by intermittent lesions and hyperpermeability caused by chronic inflammation. A consequence of the damaged intestinal mucosa is a reduced AP level and an increased influx of LPS responsive cells that
maintain the inflammatory response. In the gastrointestinal tract, the prime source of LPS is derived from the residing Gram-negative microorganisms. AP reduces LPS-mediated

SV2A is a membrane glycoprotein present in synaptic vesicles of neurons that plays a role as calcium regulators in neurotransmitter release and modulate synaptic networks. Seletracetam is thought to reduce excessive neuronal activity by modulating SV2A function and restoring the ability of a neuron to regulate its neurotransmitter release.
Seizure generation induces a sustained membrane depolarization causing a prolonged firing of voltage-dependent calcium currents sufficient to induce a significant rise in calcium concentration. High voltage-activated calcium currents are inhibited by seletracetam by blocking N-type calcium channels in the pyramidal neurons.

DB05889,Inotuzumab ozogamicin,,"Inotuzumab ozogamicin is comprised of cytotoxic antibiotic N-acetyl-gamma-calicheamicin dimethylhydrazide attached to a humanized monoclonal IgG4 antibody via 4-(4 acetylphenoxy) butanoic acid (acetyl butyrate) linker. The drug exerts a potent cytotoxic effect against CD22+ B-cell lymphoma when the antibody binds to the CD22 receptor on the surface of B cells . The drug-CD22 complex is rapidly internalized into the cell, forming an endosome which subsequently fuses with lysosomes. N-acetyl-gamma-calicheamicin dimethylhydrazide is then intracellularly released into the acidic environment. N-acetyl-gamma-calicheamicin dimethylhydrazide is a calicheamicin derivative, which is naturally produced by the bacterium Micromonospora echinospora, and is toxic to the body when not bound to the antibody. It mediates apoptosis of the cell by binding to the minor groove of DNA in a sequence-specific manner and undergoing a structural change to generate diradicals [A20354]. These changes abstract hydrogen ions from the phosphodiester bonds of double-stranded DNA, resulting in breaks and cell apoptosis [A3883, A3884, A20352]. "
DB05890,VEGF-AS,,"(VEGF-AS)Veglin is an antisense oligonucleotide that binds with DNA genes that are responsible for the production of proteins called Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors (VEGF), with the intention of inhibiting their production. VEGF (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor) is an essential family of naturally-occurring growth factors found in humans and other animals that stimulates growth and supports survival of cells of the vascular system. VEGF is necessary for production of the blood vessels that transport nutrients and oxygen to cells and organs (angiogenesis). Without these vessels, tumors have limited capacity to grow. In addition, certain tumor cells themselves express the receptors for VEGF, and use VEGF as a growth stimulus."
DB05892,RI 624,,"RI 624 works very differently from all currently approved drugs for the treatment of pain. Unlike the other pain relievers, RI 624 primarily works to inhibit the production of NGF, rather than COX-2 for instance. NGF is a member of a family of proteins known as neurotrophins that plays a role in the growth of certain sensory neurons, an activity that appears to end at birth or shortly afterward. Pain-causing injury or inflammation induces the synthesis and stimulates the release of NGF in later stages of life. Scientific observation has shown that the up-regulation of NGF is a common component of the inflammatory response that initiates and sustains the pain sensation. NGF therefore appears to have profound direct and indirect stimulatory effects on the primary sensory neurons that mediate pain. RI 624 essentially blocks NGF from binding to its target area and thus impedes an imflammatory response."

The inhibition of the tyrosine kinase activity of Kit is expected to result in reduced cancer cell proliferation and increased cellular apoptosis in tumor types driven by Kit, resulting in inhibition of tumor growth. OSI-930 is also capable of inhibiting VEGFR-2. This receptor is present on endothelial cells and is a key mediator of blood vessel growth in response to the angiogenic growth factor VEGF. This pathway is believed to be the single most important mechanism for recruitment of new blood vessels in nearly all solid tumors. Inhibition of this pathway should therefore impact the growth and metastases of a wide range of angiogenesis-dependent malignancies. "

DB06151,Acetylcysteine,CHEMBL600,"Acetylcysteine protects against acetaminophen overdose-induced hepatotoxicity by maintaining or restoring hepatic concentrations of glutathione. It does this by producing the glutathione precursor L-cysteine. Glutathione is required to inactivate an intermediate metabolite (N-acetyl-p-benzoquinoneimine or NAPQI) of acetaminophen that is thought to be hepatotoxic. In acetaminophen overdose cases, excessive quantities of this metabolite are formed because the primary metabolic (glucuronide and sulfate conjugation) pathways become saturated. Acetylcysteine may act by reducing the metabolite to the parent compound and/or by providing sulfhydryl for conjugation of the metabolite. Experimental evidence also suggests that a sulfhydryl-containing compound such as acetylcysteine may also directly inactivate the metabolite. The mechanisms of action for acetylcysteine’s well-known mucolytic effects are different.  In particular, when inhaled, acetylcysteine (and its metabolic byproduct cysteine) exerts its mucolytic action through its free sulfhydryl group, which reduces the disulfide bonds in the mucus matrix and lowers mucus viscosity. This action increases with increasing pH and is most significant at pH 7 to 9. The mucolytic action of acetylcysteine is not affected by the presence of DNA. Acetylcysteine is also an antioxidant and reduces oxidative stress. Acetylcysteine serves as a prodrug to L-cysteine which is a precursor to the biologic antioxidant, glutathione and hence administration of acetylcysteine replenishes glutathione stores. L-cysteine also serves as a precursor to cystine which in turn serves as a substrate for the cystine-glutamate antiporter on astrocytes hence increasing glutamate release into the extracellular space. This glutamate in turn acts on mGluR2/3 receptors, and at higher doses of acetylcysteine, mGluR5. Glutathione also modulates the NMDA receptor by acting at the redox site. These effects on glutamate and NMDA signaling appear to explain some of the positive neuropsychotropic effects associated with NAC.  Acetylcysteine also possesses some anti-inflammatory effects possibly via inhibiting NF-κB through redox activation of the nuclear factor kappa kinases thereby modulating cytokine synthesis."

DB06193,Pixantrone,CHEMBL167731,"Pixantrone is an aza-anthracenedione which acts as a DNA intercalator. By intercalating between DNA, with modest affinity, it stimulates DNA cleavage by topoisomerase II. (Pixantrone acts as a poison to topoisomerase II by stabilizing protein-DNA complexes which are usually transient, giving rise to double stranded DNA breaks.)
However, pixantrone is believed to have additional mechanisms of action as its potency does not correlate to the degree of double stranded DNA breaks observed. It has been postulated that this second mechanism may be pixantrone-DNA adduct formation. [1]  

It is important to note that the formation of a pixtantrone-DNA adduct requires pixantrone activation by formaldehyde. Formadehyde may be generated in vitro by hydrogen peroxide, and is derived by various sources in biological systems. It is present in low levels as a result of normal metabolism, and may be present in elevated levels in some haematolgical malignancies. [1] The formation of pixantrone-DNA adducts is thus feasible, and it is believed that a long pixantrone-DNA adduct half life has the potential to maximize DNA damage. It may do so by enhancing the disruption of DNA replication and transcription, and potentially by encourage apoptosis. [1]

In explanation of pixantrones lack of cardiotoxicity, it has been elucidated that pixantrone is structurally similar to mitoxantrone; however, instead of a 5,8-dihydroxyphenyl ring (thought to be responsible for cardiotoxicity) it has a nitrogen heteroatom. This nitrogen heteroatom helps to create additional hydrogen bonding sites amd increases pixantrone interaction with DNA and topoisomerase II. [2] 

Pixantrone's lack of a hydroquinone is believed to render it resistant to one electron reduction. In contrast, doxorubicin - which contains a hydroquinone - experiences one electron redox cycling and ROS formation via NADH dehydrogenase. [3] Pixantrone also does not bind iron, and thus does not produce ROS by redox cycling between oxidative states of iron, as other anthracyclines do. [2]

The first line agent doxorubicin is cardiotoxic, in part, due to its ability to redox activate the superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide, and form a long-lived secondary alcohol metabolite: doxorubicinol. [3] Clearance of doxorubicin from myocardial tissue is incomplete, and it can be found months or years after the last administration. [3] In doxorubicin treated ex vivo cardiac strips, pixantrone formed an N-dealkylated product that inhibited metabolism of residual doxorubicin into doxorubicinol. Additionally, in ex vivo human myocardial strips (doxorubicin naive, and doxorubicin pretreated) pixantrone showed high cardiac uptake without formation of superoxide anion or hydrogen peroxide. Pixantrones lack of cardiotoxicity is thus attributed to its redox inactivity and inhibition of doxorubicinol formation. [3]  "

Carbapenems mainly have high affinity for PBPs 1a, 1b, 2 and 3. Inhibition of each PBP usually results in a different inactivating mechanism. Inhibition of PBPs 1a and 1b results in fast bacterial killing through the formation of spheroplasts, inhibition of PBP 2 results in rod-shaped bacteria to become spherical, and inhibition of PBP 3 results in filamentous-shaped organisms. The PBPs preferentially bound by different carbapenems depend on the organism. In E.coli and P.aeruginosa, doripenem binds to PBP

DB06273,Tocilizumab,CHEMBL1237022,"Interleukin (IL)-6 plays essential roles not only in the immune response, but also in haematopoiesis and the central nervous system. Unregulated production of IL-6 has been found in chronic inflammatory autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis (soJIA), Crohn's disease (CD), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and vasculitis. Furthermore, IL-6 activities can explain many symptoms of these diseases. More importantly, serum levels of IL-6 are correlated with disease activity. Tocilizumab binds specifically to both soluble and membrane-bound IL-6 receptors (sIL-6R and mIL-6R), and has been shown to inhibit IL-6-mediated signaling through these receptors."

Temsirolimus binds to an intracellular protein (FKBP-12), and the protein-drug complex inhibits the activity of mTOR that controls cell division. Inhibition of mTOR activity resulted in a G1 growth arrest in treated tumor cells. When mTOR was inhibited, its ability to phosphorylate p70S6k and S6 ribosomal protein, which are downstream of mTOR in the PI3 kinase/AKT pathway was blocked. In in vitro studies using renal cell carcinoma cell lines, temsirolimus inhibited the activity of mTOR and resulted in reduced levels of the hypoxia-inducible factors HIF-1 and HIF-2 alpha, and the vascular endothelial growth factor."

It may also have 5-ht7 antagonistic effect, useful in depression treatment."
DB06290,Simeprevir,CHEMBL501849,"Simeprevir is accumulated in the liver after uptake into hepatocytes via OATP1B1/3. NS3/4A heterodimeric complex is composed of the cofactor N4A subunit and N3 subunit which contains the proteolytic site. The NS3/4A protease cleaves the HCV polyprotein downstream of the NS3 site, generating non-structural viral proteins NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A and NS5A and subsequently formation of mature proteins [A19630, A19632]. Simeprevir exerts an inhibitory action on HCV polyprotein cleavage via induced-fit binding to an extended S2 subsite located in the NS3 catalytic site [A19633]. NS3/4A inhibitors usually depend on few interactions located in the substrate binding groove of the viral serine protease, thus are susceptible to resistance and failed treatment from few critical mutations in these sites. 
At higher concentration above their antiviral half-maximal effective concentration (EC50), simeprevir and other NS3/4A inhibitors also restore interferon (IFN)-signaling pathways that are thought to be disrupted by NS3/4A protease and recover innate immune processes. NS3/4A protease cleaves two essential adaptor proteins that initiate signaling leading to activation of IFN regulatory factor 3 and IFN-α/β synthesis, which are mitochondrial antiviral-signaling proteins (MAVS otherwise known as IPS-1, VISA, or Cardif) and toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR)- domain-containing adaptor-inducing IFN-β (TRIF). Blocking the function of these adaptor proteins results in impaired interferon induction. NS3/4A inhibitors recover the proper IFN-signaling pathways [A19630, A19632]. "

SLAMF7 is also expressed on Natural Killer cells, plasma cells, and at lower levels on specific immune cell subsets of differentiated cells within the hematopoietic lineage. Elotuzumab directly activates Natural Killer cells through both the SLAMF7 pathway and Fc receptors. Elotuzumab also targets SLAMF7 on myeloma cells and facilitates the interaction with Natural Killer cells to mediate the killing of myeloma cells through antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). In preclinical models, the combination of elotuzumab and lenalidomide resulted in enhanced activation of Natural Killer cells that was greater than the effects of either agent alone and increased anti-tumor activity in vitro and in vivo."
DB06335,Saxagliptin,CHEMBL385517,"Saxagliptin is a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor antidiabetic for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. DPP-4 inhibitors are a class of compounds that work by affecting the action of natural hormones in the body called incretins. Incretins decrease blood sugar by increasing consumption of sugar by the body, mainly through increasing insulin production in the pancreas, and by reducing production of sugar by the liver. [Bristol-Myers Squibb Press Release]
DPP-4 is a membrane associated peptidase which is found in many tissues, lymphocytes and plasma. DPP-4 has two main mechanisms of action, an enzymatic function and another mechanism where DPP-4 binds adenosine deaminase, which conveys intracellular signals via dimerization when activated. Saxagliptin forms a reversible, histidine-assisted covalent bond between its nitrile group and the S630 hydroxyl oxygen on DPP-4. The inhibition of DPP-4 increases levels active of glucagon like peptide 1 (GLP-1), which inhibits glucagon production from pancreatic alpha cells and increases production of insulin from pancreatic beta cells.

DB06372,Rilonacept,CHEMBL1201830,"CAPS refer to rare genetic syndromes generally caused by mutations in the NLRP-3 [Nucleotide-binding domain, leucine rich family (NLR), pyrin domain containing 3] gene (also known as Cold-Induced Auto-inflammatory Syndtrome-1 [CIAS1]). CAPS disorders are inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern with male and female offspring equally affected. Fever, urticaria-like rash, arthralgia, myalgia, fatigue, and conjunctivitis are features common to all disorders. In most cases, inflammation in CAPS is associated with mutations in the NLRP-3 gene which encodes the protein cryopyrin, an important component of the inflammasome. Cryopyrin regulates the protease caspase-1 and controls the activation of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β). Mutations in NLRP-3 result in an overactive inflammasome resulting in excessive release of activated IL-1β that drives inflammation. Rilonacept blocks IL-1β signaling by acting as a soluble decoy receptor that binds IL-1β and prevents its interaction with cell surface receptors. Rilonacept also binds IL-1α and IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) with reduced affinity. By binding IL-1, rilonacept prevents the activation of IL-1 receptors, thus reducing inflammatory responses and other effects related to an excess of IL-1."
DB06395,Abafungin,,"Abafungin has been shown to have fungicidal and fungistatic effects on a wide variety of pathogens, including dermatophytes, yeasts (Candida) and moulds. The drug acts on the infecting organisms in two ways: by interfering with the formation of a vital sterol in the fungal cell membrane, thereby preventing cell growth, and also by direct interaction with another membrane component resulting in membrane disruption, leakage of cellular contents and death of the cell and independent of whether it is in a non-metabolising (`resting') phase of development or actively growing. These features of abafungin, combined with the attainment of microbicidal concentrations in the skin from a 1% preparation, its long residence at the site of dermal application and the lack of significant systemic absorption, mean that Abasol(tm) is particularly attractive for the topical treatment of dermatomycoses, which is the first indication under review for marketing approval."
DB06401,Bazedoxifene,CHEMBL46740,"Bazedoxifene belongs to a class of compounds known as selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs). Bazedoxifene acts as both an oestrogen-receptor agonist and/or antagonist, depending upon the cell and tissue type and target genes. Bazedoxifene decreases bone resorption and reduces biochemical markers of bone turnover to the premenopausal range. These effects on bone remodelling lead to an increase in bone mineral density (BMD), which in turn contributes to a reduction in the risk of fractures. Bazedoxifene functions primarily as an oestrogen-receptor antagonist in uterine and breast tissues."
DB06402,Telavancin,CHEMBL507870,"Telavancin is a bactericidal lipoglycopeptide that is active against a broad range of gram-positive bacteria. Telavancin prevents polymerization of N-acetylmuramic acid (NAM) and N-acetylglucosamine (NAG) and cross-linking of peptidoglycan by binding to D-Ala-D-Ala. As a result, inhibition of bacterial cell wall synthesis occurs. Furthermore, telavancin disrupts membrane potential and cell permeability as a result of the lipophillic side chain moiety. This additional bactericidal mechanism is what sets telavancin apart from vancomycin. "
DB06403,Ambrisentan,CHEMBL1111,"Endothelin-1 (ET-1) is an endogenous peptide that acts on the endothelin type A (ETA) and endothelin type B (ETB) receptors in vascular smooth muscle and endothelium. ETA-mediated actions include vasoconstriction and cell proliferation, whereas ETB predominantly mediates vasodilation, anti-proliferation, and ET-1 clearance. In patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension, ET-1 levels are increased and correlate with increased right arterial pressure and severity of disease.
Ambrisentan is one of several newly developed vasodilator drugs that selectively target the endothelin type A (ETA) receptor, inhibiting its action and preventing vasoconstriction. Selective inhibition of the ETA receptor prevents phospholipase C-mediated vasoconstriction and protein kinase C-mediated cell proliferation. Endothelin type B (ETB) receptor function is not significantly inhibited, and nitric oxide and prostacyclin production, cyclic GMP- and cyclic AMP-mediated vasodilation, and endothelin-1 (ET-1) clearance is preserved."
DB06404,Human C1-esterase inhibitor,,"C1 inhibitor is a normal constituent of human blood and is one of the serine proteinase inhibitors (serpins). The primary function of C1 inhibitor is to regulate the activation of the complement and intrinsic coagulation (contact system) pathway. C1 inhibitor also regulates the fibrinolytic system. Regulation of these systems is performed through the formation of complexes between the proteinases and the inhibitor, resulting in inactivation of both and consumption of the C1 inhibitor. HAE patients have low levels of endogenous or functional C1 inhibitor. Although the events that induce attacks of angioedema in HAE patients are not well defined, it is thought by some that increased vascular permeability and the clinical manifestation of HAE attacks are primarily mediated through contact system activation. Suppression of contact system activation by C1 inhibitor through the inactivation of plasma kallikrein and factor XIIa is thought to modulate this vascular permeability by preventing the generation of bradykinin1. Administration of C1 Esterase Inhibitor increases plasma levels of C1 inhibitor activity."
DB06410,Doxercalciferol,CHEMBL1200810,"Calcitriol (1α,25-(OH)2D3) and 1α,25-(OH)2D2 regulate blood calcium at levels required for essential body functions. Specifically, the biologically active vitamin D metabolites control the intestinal absorption of dietary calcium, the tubular reabsorption of calcium by the kidney and, in conjunction with parathyroid hormone (PTH), the mobilization of calcium from the skeleton. They act directly on bone cells (osteoblasts) to stimulate skeletal growth, and on the parathyroid glands to suppress PTH (parathyroid hormone) synthesis and secretion. These functions are mediated by the interaction of these biologically active metabolites with specific receptor proteins in the various target tissues. In patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), deficient production of biologically active vitamin D metabolites (due to lack of or insufficient 25-hydroxyvitamin D-1-alpha-hydroxylase activity) leads to secondary hyperparathyroidism, which contributes to the development of metabolic bone disease.

DB06412,Oxymetholone,CHEMBL1200585,"Oxymethalone is a 17 alpha-alkylated anabolic-androgenic steroid and a synthetic derivative of testosterone, whose anabolic effects are used to treat muscle wasting in HIV patients. The effects of testosterone in humans and other vertebrates occur by way of two main mechanisms: by activation of the androgen receptor (directly or as DHT), and by conversion to estradiol and activation of certain estrogen receptors. Free testosterone (T) is transported into the cytoplasm of target tissue cells, where it can bind to the androgen receptor, or can be reduced to 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) by the cytoplasmic enzyme 5α-reductase. DHT binds to the same androgen receptor even more strongly than T, so that its androgenic potency is about 2.5 times that of T. The T-receptor or DHT-receptor complex undergoes a structural change that allows it to move into the cell nucleus and bind directly to specific nucleotide sequences of the chromosomal DNA. The areas of binding are called hormone response elements (HREs), and influence transcriptional activity of certain genes, producing the androgen effects."

Belatacept specifically binds to CD80 and CD86 receptors that are found on the antigen-presenting cell (B cells, macrophages, dendritic cells) to block selective T-cell lymphocyte costimulation. CD80 and CD86 would normally act as the ligands to the CD28 receptor T-cells in which this interaction triggers the activation of T lymphocytes. However in the presence of belatacept, because the extracellular CTLA-4 component binds to CD28 with higher affinity than CD80 or CD86, T lymphyocyte anergy, a state of antigen specific tolerance, occurs instead. The T cell is also no longer able to respond to their antigen. "

As a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, vilazodone prevents serotonin from re-entering cell bodies. Hence, they will remain longer in the synapse. Vilazodone also has an inherent selectivity for serotonin-1A receptors, acting as a partial agonist which stimulates the production of serotonin. The end result is increased serotonin in the synaptic cleft, allowing serotonin to resume its action on nearby cells. The mechanism of the antidepressant effect of vilazodone is not fully understood, but is thought to be related to its enhancement of serotonergic activity in the CNS through selective inhibition of serotonin reuptake."

Specifically Arbekacin binds to four nucleotides of 16S rRNA and a single amino acid of protein S12. This interferes with decoding site in the vicinity of nucleotide 1400 in 16S rRNA of 30S subunit. This region interacts with the wobble base in the anticodon of tRNA. This leads to misreading of mRNA so incorrect amino acids are inserted into the polypeptide leading to nonfunctional or toxic peptides and the breakup of polysomes into nonfunctional monosomes.

DB06706,Isometheptene,CHEMBL1697841,"Isometheptene's vasoconstricting properties arise through activation of the sympathetic nervous system via epinephrine and norepinephrine (or their molecular analogues as is the case with this drug). These compounds elicites smooth muscle activation leading to vasoconstriction. These compounds interact with cell surface adrenergic receptors. Such stimuli result in a signal transduction cascade that leads to increased intracellular calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum through IP3 mediated calcium release, as well as enhanced calcium entry across the sarcolemma through calcium channels. The rise in intracellular calcium complexes with calmodulin, which in turn activates myosin light chain kinase. This enzyme is responsible for phosphorylating the light chain of myosin to stimulate cross bridge cycling.

Once elevated, the intracellular calcium concentration is returned to its basal level through a variety of protein pumps and calcium exchangers located on the plasma membrane and sarcoplasmic reticulum. This reduction in calcium removes the stimulus necessary for contraction allowing for a return to baseline.

DB06710,Methyltestosterone,CHEMBL1395,"The effects of testosterone in humans and other vertebrates occur by way of two main mechanisms: by activation of the androgen receptor (directly or as DHT), and by conversion to estradiol and activation of certain estrogen receptors. Free testosterone (T) is transported into the cytoplasm of target tissue cells, where it can bind to the androgen receptor, or can be reduced to 5&alpha;-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) by the cytoplasmic enzyme 5&alpha;-reductase. DHT binds to the same androgen receptor even more strongly than T, so that its androgenic potency is about 2.5 times that of T. The T-receptor or DHT-receptor complex undergoes a structural change that allows it to move into the cell nucleus and bind directly to specific nucleotide sequences of the chromosomal DNA. The areas of binding are called hormone response elements (HREs), and influence transcriptional activity of certain genes, producing the androgen effects."

New research indicates that halcinonide activates MBP (myelin basic protein) expression via smoothened receptor activation. This finding suggests that halcinonide could be used in the treatment of multiple sclerosis therapy as an alternative to Dexamethasone or Methylprednisolone. "
DB06787,Hexocyclium,CHEMBL1201325,Hexocyclium binds to and inhibits muscarinic acetylcholine receptors [A19700]. This decreases gastric acid secretion by preventing the activation of M3 receptors on pareital cells and subsequent stimulation of gastric acid secretion [T28]. The antagonism of M3 receptors in the intestine inhibits smooth muscle contraction resulting in a decrease in motility. The binding of hexocyclium to other muscarinic receptor types produces typical anti-muscarinic side effects.
DB06788,Histrelin,CHEMBL1201255,"Histrelin is a gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist that acts as a potent inhibitor of gonadotropin when administered as an implant that delivers continuous therapeutic doses. Following an initial stimulatory phase with increased circulating levels of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), leading to a transient increase in concentration of gonadal steroids (testosterone and dihydrotestosterone in males), continuous administration of histrelin acetate results in decreased levels of LH and FSH due to a reversible down-regulation of the GnRH receptors in the pituitary gland and desensitization of the pituitary gonadotropes. "
DB06789,Hydroxyprogesterone caproate,CHEMBL1200848,"The mechanism by which progesterone prevents preterm birth is not well understood, but many pathways are likely involved. (1)  Progesterone plays a vital role in regulation of the female reproductive system and is important for successful implantation of the embryo and maintenance of pregnancy.  It acts by binding to progesterone receptors in the uterus, ovaries, breasts and in the central nervous system.  These receptors exist in 2 isoforms, PR-A and PR-B.  Progesterone binding to these receptors ultimately leads to regulation of gene transcription. (2)  This results in an anti-inflammatory effect which blunts the proinflammatory state that occurs with initiation of labor, and maintains uterine queiscence by stabilizing progesterone acting on the myometrium. (2) "
DB06791,Lanreotide,CHEMBL1201185,"Lanreotide is a somatostatin analogue (SSA) and has mainly inhibitory effects which are mediated via somatostatin receptors (SSTRs) 2 and 5 and include inhibition of growth hormone release in the brain.  Tumor SSTR activation induces downstream cell cycle arrest and/or apoptosis, and also results in blunted production of substances that support tumor growth as well as tumor angiogenesis.  This leads to the anti-proliferative effects of Lanreotide. (3)"
DB06792,Lanthanum carbonate,CHEMBL2096647,Lanthanum carbonate is a phosphate binder that reduces absorption of phosphate by forming insoluble lanthanum phosphate complexes that pass through the gastrointestinal (GI) tract unabsorbed. Both serum phosphate and calcium phosphate product are reduced as a consequence of the reduced dietary phosphate absorption.
DB06793,Levopropoxyphene,CHEMBL1738990,
DB06794,Lodoxamide,CHEMBL1201266,"Although lodoxamide's precise mechanism of action is unknown, it is postulated that it prevents calcium influx into mast cells upon antigen stimulation and therefore stabilizes the membrane. By stabilizing the mast cell membrane from degranulation, lodoxamide consequently inhibits the release of intracellular histamine and other chemoattractant factors that primarily cause ocular symptoms. Lodoxamide's mechanism of action may be similar to cromolyn sodium, as both exhibit cross-tachyphylaxis. "
DB06795,Mafenide,CHEMBL419,"The precise mechanism of mafenide is unknown. However, mafenide reduces the bacterial population in the avascular burn tissue and promotes spontaneous heeling of deep burns. "
DB06796,Mangafodipir,,"After intravenous administration, the chelate dissociates slowly to manganese and organic ligand fodipir (dipyridoxyl diphosphate), and manganese is taken up by the hepatocytes with high affinity and selectivity. The ligand fodipir is distributed to the extracellular fluid and later eliminated via urine [A19708]. Mangafodipir shortens the longitudinal relaxation time (T1) of targeted tissues during MRI, where signal intensity or brightness is increased in normal liver parenchyma. Overall, there is increased contrast between normal tissue and abnormal tissue with lesions because there is a difference between cellular compositions [A19716], and manganese uptake in metastatic tissue or focal lesions is minimal or nearly absent [A19706]."
DB06799,Methenamine,CHEMBL1201270,"Methenamine does not have antibacterial properties in an alkaline environment (pH≥6); however, in a more acidic environment (pH<6), methenamine is hydrolyzed to formaldehyde. (1)  Formaldehyde is considered to be highly bactericidal. (1)  Formaldehyde has nonspecific antibacterial activity and works by denaturing proteins and nucleic acid of bacteria. (1)  Certain bacteria such as Proteus sp. can alkalize urine, inhibiting the beneficial activity of formaldehyde. (1)  The key role of the salt component of the drug, for example hippuric acid, is to maintain the acidic state of the urine. (1)"
DB06800,Methylnaltrexone,CHEMBL1186579,"Methylnaltrexone is a pheriphally-acting μ-opioid antagonists that acts on the gastrointestinal tract inhibit opioid-induced decrease in gastric motility and transit time. Because methylnaltrexone is a quaternary derivative of naltrexone, it produces its gastrointestinal effects without producing analgesic effects or withdrawal symptoms as it does not cross the blood-brain-barrier. "
DB06802,Nepafenac,CHEMBL1021,"Nepafenac is a prodrug. After penetrating the cornea, nepafenac undergoes rapid bioactivation to amfenac, which is a potent NSAID that uniformly inhibits the COX1 and COX2 activity."
DB06803,Niclosamide,CHEMBL1448,"Niclosamide works by killing tapeworms on contact. Adult worms (but not ova) are rapidly killed, presumably due to uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation or stimulation of ATPase activity. The killed worms are then passed in the stool or sometimes destroyed in the intestine. Niclosamide may work as a molluscicide by binding to and damaging DNA."
DB06804,Nonoxynol-9,CHEMBL1410,"Nonoxynol-9 interacts with the lipids in the membranes of the acrosome and the midpiece of the sperm. The sperm membranes are lysed; the acrosome, neck and midpiece of the spermatozoa are loosened and then detached which results in their immobilization and death."

By blocking the interaction between SDF-1α and CXCR4 with plerixafor, mobilization of progenitor cells is triggered. Filgrastim, a granulocyte-colony stimulating factor, is added to enhance CD34+ cell mobilization, thus increasing the yield of stem cells- an important determinant of graft adequacy. "
DB06810,Plicamycin,CHEMBL1237054,Plicamycin is presumed to inhibit cellular and enzymic RNA synthesis by forming a complex with DNA. Plicamycin may also lower calcium serum levels by inhibiting the effect of parathyroid hormone upon osteoclasts or by blocking the hypercalcemic action of pharmacologic doses of vitamin D.
DB06811,Polidocanol,CHEMBL1231723,"When administered, polidocanol locally damages blood vessel endothelium. Following the endothelial damage, platelets aggregate at the site and attach to the venous wall eventually resulting in a dense network of platelets, cellular debris, and fibrin that occludes the vessel. Eventually the vessel is replaced by connective fibrous tissue."
DB06812,Povidone-iodine,CHEMBL1201724,"Povidone -iodine is called iodophore which means it is a carrier of iodine. Iodine is considered as the active moiety. It penetrates the cell wall of microorganisms quickly, and the lethal effects are believed to result from disruption of protein and nucleic acid structure and synthesis."
DB06813,Pralatrexate,CHEMBL1201746,"The selectivity of pralatrexate for cancer cells is based upon the observation that cancer cells generally have an overexpression of reduced folate carrier protein-1 (RTC-1) compared to normal somatic cells. This carrier protein allows the entrance of pralatrexate into the cell. Upon entering the cell, folypolyglutamate synthase FPGS catalyzes the polyglutamination of pralatrexate so that it is retained inside the cell.  
Once inside, pralatrexate competitively inhibits dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) and thymidylate synthase. Subsequent depletion of thymidine monophosphate (TMP) occurs so that the cancer cell is unable to synthesize DNA and RNA. As a result, the cancer cell cannot proliferate and is forced to undergo apoptosis. Pralatrexate is more effective against cells that are actively dividing. "

DB06816,Pyrvinium,CHEMBL1201303,"Pyrvinium is believed to interfere with glucose uptake by pinworms [T39].

Pyrvinium is also thought to inhibit mitochondrial respiration complex 1 and suppress the unfolded protein response [A19733]. It is also believed to supress the Wnt pathway by activating casein kinase 1α. These properties have led to the investigation of pyrvinium's activity against cancers like intestinal polyposis [A19734]."
DB06817,Raltegravir,CHEMBL254316,"Raltegravir targets integrase, an HIV enzyme that integrates the viral genetic material into human chromosomes, a critical step in the pathogenesis of HIV. The drug is metabolized away via glucuronidation."
DB06819,Phenylbutyric acid,CHEMBL1469,"Sodium phenylbutyrate is a pro-drug that is metabolized to the active compound phenylacetate. Phenylacetate conjuages with glutamine via acetylation reaction to form the  product phenylacetylglutamine, which is excreted by the kidneys.  This provides an alternative mechanism for waste nitrogen excretion. "
DB06820,Sulconazole,CHEMBL1221,
DB06822,Tinzaparin,,"Tinzaparin binds to the plasma protein antithrombin III, forming a complex with then accelerates the inhibition of factor Xa. Its affinity for factor Xa is 2-4 times greater than that of unbound ATIII. The inactivation of factor Xa in turn will exponentially generation of thrombin (factor IIa) molecules, which is needed to activate fibrinogen to fibrin. The coagulation cascade is inhibited because fibrin cannot be formed in the presence of tinzaparin. Like all LMWH, it cannot be given intramuscularly due to increased risk of hematoma."
DB06823,Tiopronin,CHEMBL1314,"Kidney stones form when the solubility limit is exceeded and urine becomes supersaturated with endogenous cystine. Tiopronin is an active reducing agent which undergoes a thiol-disulfide exchange with cystine to form a water-soluble mixed disulfide complex. Thus, the amount of sparingly soluble cystine is reduced. By reducing urinary cystine concentrations below the solubility limit, tiopronin helps reduce cystine stone formation. "
DB06824,Triethylenetetramine,CHEMBL609,"Copper is chelated by forming a stable complex with the four constituent nitrogens in a planar ring as copper displays enhanced ligand binding properties for nitrogen compared to oxygen. It binds Cu(II) very tightly, having a dissociation constant from Cu(II) of 10^−15 mol/L at pH 7.0 . TETA reacts in a stoichiometric ratio 1:1 with copper and is also able to complex with iron and zinc in vivo. TETA is considered a potential chemotherapeutic agent as it could be a telomerase inhibitor because it is a ligand for G-quadruplex, and stabilizes both intra- and intermolecular G-quadruplexes. It may mediate a selective inhibitory effect or cytotoxicity on tumor growth. Chelating excess copper may affect copper-induced angiogenesis. Other mechanisms of action of TETA for alternative therapeutic implications include improved antioxidant defense against oxidative stress, pro-apoptosis, and reduced inflammation. "
DB06825,Triptorelin,CHEMBL1201334,"Triptorelin is a synthetic agonist analog of gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH).  Animal studies comparing triptorelin to native GnRH found that triptorelin had 13 fold higher releasing activity for luteinizing hormone, and 21-fold higher releasing activity for follicle-stimulating hormone."
DB06826,Unoprostone,CHEMBL1201407,"Unoprostone  is believed to reduce elevated intraocular pressure (IOP), by increasing the outflow of aqueous humor. The mechanism of action for the IOP-lowering effect of unoprostone is controversial. Early studies showed that unoprostone increases aqueous humor outflow through the uveoscleral pathway similar to the 20-carbon prostaglandin analogs, such as latanoprost.8 More recent evidence, however, shows that it may work, at least in part, through stimulation of Ca2+-activated BK and CIC-2 type channels, leading to increased trabecular meshwork outflow."
DB06827,Viomycin,CHEMBL3085436,"The tuberactinomycins, such as Viomycin, target bacterial ribosomes, binding RNA and disrupting bacterial protein biosynthesis. Specifically, viomycin binds to a site on the ribosome which lies at the interface between helix 44 of the small ribosomal subunit and helix 69 of the large ribosomal subunit. The structures of this complexes suggest that the viomycin inhibits translocation by stabilizing the tRNA in the A site in the pretranslocation state."

At lower concentrations, however, triclosan appears bacteriostatic and is seen to target bacteria mainly by inhibiting fatty acid synthesis. Triclosan binds to bacterial enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase enzyme (ENR), which is encoded by the gene FabI. This binding increases the enzyme's affinity for nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+). This results in the formation of a stable ternary complex of ENR-NAD+-triclosan, which is unable to participate in fatty acid synthesis. Fatty acids are necessary for reproducing and building cell membranes. Humans do not have an ENR enzyme, and thus are not affected."

DB08818,Hyaluronic acid,,"Hyaluronic acid functions as a tissue lubricant and is thought to play an important role in modulating the interactions between adjacent tissues. Hyaluronic acid is a polysaccharide which is distributed widely in the extracellular matrix of connective tissue in man. It forms a viscoelastic solution in water which makes it suitable for aqueous and vitreous humor in ophthalmic surgery. Mechanical protection for tissues (iris, retina) and cell layers (corneal, endothelium, and epithelium) are provided by the high viscosity of the solution. Elasticity of the solution assists in absorbing mechanical stress and providing a protective buffer for tissues. This viscoelasticity enables maintenance of a deep chamber during surgical manipulation since the solution does not flow out of the open anterior chamber. In facilitating wound healing, it is thought that it acts as a protective transport vehicle, taking peptide growth factors and other structural proteins to a site of action. It is then enzymatically degraded and active proteins are released to promote tissue repair. Hyaluronic acid is being used intra-articularly to treat osteoarthritis. Cell receptors that have been identified for hyaluronic acid fall into three main groups: CD44, Receptor for Hyaluronan-mediated motility (RHAMM) and intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1).

CD44 mediates cell interaction with hyaluronic acid and the binding of the two functions as an important part in various physiologic events, such as cell aggregation, migration, proliferation and activation; cell-cell and cell-substrate adhesion; endocytosis of hyaluronic acid, which leads to hyaluronic acid catabolism in macrophages; and assembly of petircellular matrices from HA and proteoglycan. CD44 has two important roles in skin, regulation of keratinocyte proliferation in response to extracellular stimuli and the maintenance of local hyaluronic acid homeostasis.

ICAM-1 is known mainly as a metabolic cell surface receptor for hyaluronic acid, and this protein may be responsible mainly for the clearance of hyaluronic acid from lymph and blood plasma, which accounts for perhaps most of its whole-body turnover. Ligand binding of this receptor, thus, triggers a highly coordinated cascade of events that includes the formation of an endocytotic vesicle, its fusion with primary lysosomes, enzymatic digestion to monosaccharides, active transmembrane transport of these sugars to cell sap, phosphorylation of GlcNAc and enzymatic deacetylation. ICAM-1 may also serve as a cell adhesion molecule, and the binding of hyaluronic acid to ICAM-1 may contribute to the control of ICAM-1-mediated inflammatory activation."
DB08819,Tafluprost,CHEMBL1963683,Tafluprost acid is a prostanoid selective FP receptor agonist that is believed to reduce the intraocular pressure (IOP) by increasing the outflow of aqueous humor. Studies in animals and humans suggest that the main mechanism of action is increased uveoscleral outflow.
DB08820,Ivacaftor,CHEMBL2010601,"Ivacaftor exerts its effect by acting as a potentiator of the CFTR protein, an ion channel involved in the transport of chloride and sodium ions across cell membranes of the lungs, pancreas, and other organs. Alterations in the CFTR gene result in altered production, misfolding, or function of the protein and consequently abnormal fluid and ion transport across cell membranes [A20298, A20299]. Ivacaftor improves CF symptoms and underlying disease pathology by potentiating the channel open probability (or gating) of CFTR protein in patients with impaired CFTR gating mechanisms. The overall level of ivacaftor-mediated CFTR chloride transport is dependent on the amount of CFTR protein at the cell surface and how responsive a particular mutant CFTR protein is to ivacaftor potentiation [FDA Label]."

DB08831,2-deoxyglucose,CHEMBL2074932,"Solid tumors have hypoxic areas with slow growing cells that are resistant to chemotherapy, which attacks rapidly dividing cells. In the hypoxic area of the tumor, the cells rely on anaerobic glycolysis to produce energy in the form of ATP while non-tumor cells can rely on additional pathways such as fatty acid and amino acid metabolism to produce ATP. 2-deoxyglucose is an inhibitor of glycolysis because as a modified glucose molecule (it has a hydrogen at the carbon 2 position instead of a hydroxyl group), it is unable to complete the glycolysis process, and as such will hinder the survival of slow growing cancer cells. Regarding 2-deoxyglucose's antiviral activity, it prevents the glycosylation of specific proteins and lipids as well as prevents proper penetration of the virus into the target cells. In temporal lobe epilepsy, 2-deoxyglucose represses the overactive brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) promoter and prevents the increased expression of BDNF protein and TrkB receptor (BDNF's receptor) that is observed in epileptic patients."

DB08838,Agmatine,CHEMBL58343,"The exact mechanism of action is still being investigated for all of the potential indications of agmatine. Some of the biochemical mechanisms discovered so far concern agmatine's indication for diabetes, neuroprotection, and psychiatric conditions. In diabetes, agmatine produces hypoglycemia by increasing the release of insulin form pancreatic islet cells and increasing glucose uptake by the cells through increased endorphin release from the adrenal glands. Concerning neuroprotection, agmatine's effects are thought to involve modulation of receptors (NMDA, alpha 2, and imidazoline) and ion channels (ATP sensitive potassium channels and voltage-gated calcium channels) as well as blocking nitric oxide synthesis. Agmatine blocks nitric oxide synthesis by reducing the nitric oxide synthase -2 (NOS-2) protein in astroglial cells and macrophages. With respect to agmatine's benefit in psychiatric disorders, it is suggested that the mechanism involves neurotransmitter receptor modulation of the NMDA, alpha-2, serotonin, opioid, and imidazoline receptors. Specifically when agmatine binds to the imidazoline and alpha 2 receptors, it acts as a neurotransmitter and releases catecholamines from the adrenal gland. "

DB08890,Linaclotide,CHEMBL3301675,"Linaclotide is an agonist of guanylate cyclase-C (GC-C). Once linaclotide and its active metabolite binds to GC-C, it has local effect on the luminal surface of the intestinal epithelium. Activation of GC-C by linaclotide results in the intra- and extracellular increase of cyclic guanosine monophosphate concentrations (cGMP). This elevation of cGMP levels stimulates the secretion of chloride and bicarbonate into the intestinal lumen via activation of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) ion channel. Ultimately, linaclotide helps patients with IBS (especially with constipation) as GI transit is accelerated and the release of intestinal fluid is increased. In animal models, a decrease in visceral pain after administration of linaclotide may be observed. A decrease in the activity of pain-sensing nerves occurs as a result of an increase in extracellular cGMP. "

Tofacitinib is a partial and reversible janus kinase (JAK) inihibitor that will prevent the body from responding to cytokine signals. By inhibiting JAKs, tofacitinib prevents the phosphorylation and activation of STATs. The JAK-STAT signalling pathway is involved in the transcription of cells involved in hematopoiesis, and immune cell function. Tofacitinib works therapeutically by inhibiting the JAK-STAT pathway to decrease the inflammatory response.

DB08901,Ponatinib,CHEMBL1171837,"Ponatinib is a multi-target kinase inhibitor. Its primary cellular target is the Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase protein which is constitutively active and promotes the progression of CML. This protein arises from the fused Bcr and Abl gene- what is commonly known as the Philadelphia chromosome. Ponatinib is unique in that it is especially useful in the treatment of resistant CML because it inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of Abl and T315I mutant kinases. The T315I mutation confers resistance in cells as it prevents other Bcr-Abl inhibitors from binding to the Abl kinase. Other targets that ponatinib inhibits are members of the VEGFR, PDGFR, FGFR, EPH receptors and SRC families of kinases, and KIT, RET, TIE2, and FLT3.

Certolizumab pegol selectively neutralizes TNFα (IC90 of 4 ng/mL for inhibition of human TNFα in the in vitro L929 murine fibrosarcoma cytotoxicity assay). It does not bind to TNF-β. As certolizumab is only a Fab' fragment and thus missing the Fc region, it does not fix complement or cause antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Furthermore, apoptosis of monocytes or lymphocytes, or neutrophil degranulation have not been observed in vitro. "
DB08905,Formestane,CHEMBL132530,"Formestane is a second generation, irreversible, steroidal aromatase inhibitor. It inhibits the aromatase enzyme responsible for converting androgens to estrogens, thereby preventing estrogen production.  

Breast cancer may be estrogen sensitive or insensitive. 
A majority of breast cancers are estrogen sensitive. Estrogen sensitive breast cancer cells depend on estrogen for viability. Thus removal of estrogen from the body can be an effective treatment for hormone sensitive breast cancers.

Formestane has been targeted specifically for the treatment of postmenopausal women. Unlike premenopausal women who produce most estrogen in the ovaries, postmenopausal women produce most estrogen in peripheral tissues with the help of the aromatase enzyme. Formestane, an aromatase inhibitor, can thus help to decrease the local production of estrogen by blocking the aromatase enzyme in peripheral tissues (ie. adispose tissue of the breast) to treat hormone sensitive breast cancer.

Perospirone targets the mesolimbic patway to reverse the overactivity of the dopaminergic signalling via D2 receptors [T28]. 5-HT2A antagonism is thought to allevaite the negative symptoms and cognitive impairments of schizophrenia. These receptors are Gi/Go coupled receptors that lead to decreased neurotransmitter release and neuronal inhibition when activated, thus play a role in dopamine release regulation. Perospirone targets these receptors in the nigrostriatal pathway to reduce dopamine release and function. In contrast, 5-HT2A receptor antagonism may improve the negative symptoms by enhancing dopamine and glutamate release in the mesocortical pathway [T28]. 5-HT1A receptor activation further inhibits the release of 5-HT into the synaptic cleft.

When NO binds to sGC, the enzyme catalyzes synthesis of the signaling molecule cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). Intracellular cGMP plays an important role in regulating processes that influence vascular tone, proliferation, fibrosis and inflammation. Pulmonary hypertension is associated with endothelial dysfunction, impaired synthesis of nitric oxide and insufficient stimulation of the NO-sGC-cGMP pathway. 

Riociguat has a dual mode of action. It sensitizes sGC to endogenous NO by stabilizing the NO-sGC binding. Riociguat also directly stimulates sGC via a different binding site, independently of NO.

Inhibitied triglyceride synthesis results in accelerated intracellular hepatic apo B degradation and the decreased secretion of VLDL and LDL particles [A19555]. Niacin also inhibits hepatic expression of beta-chain adenosine triphosphate synthase which inhibits the removal or uptake of HDL–apo A-I. It is also suggested that niacin increases vascular endothelial cell redox state, resulting in the inhibition of oxidative stress and vascular inflammatory genes or key cytokines involved in atherosclerosis. It acts as a ligand on G-protein coupled receptor 109A (HCAR2/HM74A) and 109B (HCAR3/HM74) which mediates the anti-lipolytic and lipid-lowering effects of nicotinic acid. Niacin-mediated signalling of GPR109A expressed on adipocytes and G(i)-mediated decrease in cAMP levels result in decreased lipolysis, fatty acid mobilization, and triglyceride synthesis. The action of inositol nicotinate on GPR109A expressed on skin and macrophages to cause increased prostaglandin D2/E2 activity is thought to be less significant compared to other niacin molecules as it involves sustained release that leads to less flushing [A19555].

DB09026,Aliskiren,CHEMBL1639,"Renin is secreted by the kidney in response to decreases in blood volume and renal perfusion. Renin cleaves angiotensinogen to form the inactive decapeptide angiotensin I (Ang I). Ang I is converted to the active octapeptide angiotensin II (Ang II) by ACE and non‐ACE pathways. Ang II is a powerful vasoconstrictor and leads to the release of catecholamines from the adrenal medulla and prejunctional nerve endings. It also promotes aldosterone secretion and sodium reabsorption. Together, these effects increase blood pressure. Ang II also inhibits renin release, thus providing a negative feedback to the system. This cycle, from renin through angiotensin to aldosterone and its associated negative feedback loop, is known as the renin‐angiotensin‐aldosterone system (RAAS). Aliskiren is a direct renin inhibitor, decreasing plasma renin activity (PRA) and inhibiting the conversion of angiotensinogen to Ang I. Whether aliskiren affects other RAAS components, e.g., ACE or non‐ACE pathways, is not known. All agents that inhibit the RAAS, including renin inhibitors, suppress the negative feedback loop, leading to a compensatory rise in plasma renin concentration. When this rise occurs during treatment with ACEIs and ARBs, the result is increased levels of PRA. During treatment with aliskiren, however, the effect of increased renin levels is blocked so that PRA, Ang I and Ang II are all reduced, whether aliskiren is used as monotherapy or in combination with other antihypertensive agents."

Olaparib has been shown to inhibit growth of select tumor cell lines in vitro and decrease tumor growth in mouse xenograft models of human cancer both as monotherapy or following platinum-based chemotherapy. Increased cytotoxicity and anti-tumor activity following treatment with olaparib were noted in cell lines and mouse tumor models with deficiencies in BRCA. In vitro studies have shown that olaparib-induced cytotoxicity may involve inhibition of PARP enzymatic activity and increased formation of PARP-DNA complex, resulting in disruption of cellular homeostasis and cell death.

Beta2-adrenergic receptors are membrane-bound receptors that are normally activated by endogenous epinephrine whose signalling, via a downstream L-type calcium channel interaction, mediates smooth muscle relaxation and bronchodilation. Activation of the receptor stimulates an associated G protein which then activates adenylate cyclase, catalyzing the formation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and protein kinase A (PKA). Elevation of these two molecules induces bronchodilation by relaxation of airway smooth muscles."

Ivabradine binds by entering and attaching to a site on the channel pore from the intracellular side and disrupts If ion current flow, which prolongs diastolic depolarization, lowering heart rate. The If currents are located in the sinoatrial node and are the home of all cardiac pacemaker activity. Ivabradine therefore lowers the pacemaker firing rate, consequently lowering heart rate and reducing myocardial oxygen demand. This allows for an improved oxygen supply and therefore mitigation of ischemia, allowing for a higher exercise capacity and reduction in angina episodes. "

Conversely, benzydamine is capable of doing so without largely affecting many other pro-inflammatory (ie. like IL-6, IL-8) and anti-inflammatory cytokines (ie. like IL-10, IL-1) and does not inhibit any cyclooxygenase or lipooxygenase enzymes, allowing it to localize its action.

Benzydamine also demonstrates a non-specific antibacterial activity against various bacterial strains that are resistant to broad-spectrum antibiotics such as ampicillin, chloramphenicol, and tetracycline at concentrations of about 3 mmol/L.

Trimebutine is suggested to bind to the inactivated state of the calcium channel with high affinity. Reduced calcium influx attenuates membrane depolarization and decrease colon peristalsis. It also inhibits outward K+ currents in response to membrane depolarization of the GI smooth muscle cells at resting conditions through inhibition of delayed rectifier K+ channels and Ca2+ dependent K+ channels, which results in induced muscle contractions [A19691, A19695]. Trimebutine binds to mu opioid receptors with more selectivity compared to delta or kappa opioid receptors but with lower affinity than their natural ligands.

This vasoconstriction is though the be responsible for reducing blood flow to the esophageal tissues and so reduces bleeding from esophageal varices [A27145]. The 14 amino acid synthetic version of somatostatin is identical to the endogenous version found in humans and so has a variety of other effects [A20384]. These effects are not of interest clinically as the extremely short half life of the drug limits its use to the management of acute conditions, such as esophageal varices, by continuous infusion.

Through the ingestion of 0.5-1.5 grams (in adults) the magnesium hydroxide will act by simple acid neutralization in the stomach. The hydroxide ions from the magnesium hydroxide suspension will combine with the acidic H+ ions of the hydrochloric acid made by the stomachs parietal cells. This neutralization reaction will result in the formation of magnesium chloride and water. 

Through the ingestion of 2-5 grams (in adults) the magnesium hydroxide acts as a laxative in the colon. The majority of the suspension is not absorbed in the intestinal tract and will create an osmotic effect to draw water into the gut from surrounding tissues. With this increase of water in the intestines, the feces will soften and the intraluminal volume of the feces will increase. These effects still stimulate intestinal motility and induce the urge to defecate.

DB09112,Sodium Nitrite,CHEMBL93268,"Cyanide has a high affinity for the oxidized form of iron (Fe3+) such as that found in cytochrome oxidase a3 [A19441]. Cyanide binds to and inhibits cytochrome oxidase a3, preventing oxidative phophorylation from occuring. The resultant lack of ATP cannot support normal cellular processes, particularly in the brain. Compensatory increases in anaerobic respiration result in rising levels of lactic acid and subsequent acidosis. 

Nitrite primarily acts by oxidizing hemoglobin to methemoglobin [A19440]. The now oxidized Fe3+ in methemoglobin also binds cyanide with high affinity and accepts cyanide from cytochrome a3. This leaves cytochrome a3 free to resume its function in oxidative phosphorylation. The slow dissociation of cyanide from methemoglobin allows hepatic enzymes such as rhodanese to detoxify the compound without further systemic toxicity occuring. Methemoglobin is reduced back to hemoglobin by methemoglobin reductase allowing the affected blood cells to resume normal functioning.

The reduction of nitrite by hemoglobin results in the formation of nitric oxide [A19442].

It binds to GABA-A receptors containing any of the α, β, γ, or δ-subunits but displays strongest potency when bound to receptors containing α3 or δ subunits [A19742]. Stiripentol is an inhibitor of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), which plays a physiological role in energy metabolism of neurons and regulation of neuronal excitation. It binds to the site separate from lactate and pyruvate binding sites of the enzyme and inhibits both pyruvate-to-lactate conversion and lactate-to-pyruvate conversion [A19741]. LDH inhibitors including stiripentol as antiepileptic treatments mimic ketogenic diet, where the energy source in the brain is switched from glucose to mainly ketone bodies. The ketone bodies directly regulate neuronal excitation and seizures via ATP-sensitive potassium channels and vesicular glutamate transporters [A19741]. As a potent inhibitor of hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes, mainly CYP3A4 and CYP2C19, stiripentol co-administration with other antiepileptic drugs elevates the free unchanged active drugs (such as carbamazepine, sodium valproate, phenytoin, phenobarbital and many benzodiazepines) in the circulation to mediate their therapeutic actions.

DB09120,Zucapsaicin,CHEMBL313971,"Zucapsaicin excites and desensitizes C-fibers via agonist at TRPV1 on nociceptive neurons. It binds to intracellular sites and initially stimulates the channels, causing burning sensation. Activation of TRPV1 results in calcium influx and sodium, which leads to cell depolarization. Hypersensitization by zucapsaicin is then followed by reduced sensitivity and persistent desensitization (tachyphylaxis) of the channels via various pathways. Densentiziation is thought to be dependent on intraceullar levels of calcium [A19725]. Decreased TRPV1 channel action and release of inflammatory neuropeptides induces an analgesic effect, and pain relief [A19720, A19721]. Zucapsaicin activates calcineurin and calcium-dependent protein kinase C isoforms which results in phosphorylation of TRPV1. Phosphorylation of TRPV1 enhances reponsivity to zucapsaicin by potentiating capsaicin- or proton-evoked responses and reducing the temperature threshold for TRPV1 activation [A19725]. Studies suggest that zucapsaicin is involved in activation of phospholipase C with the subsequent phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate (PIP2) hydrolysis, which results in TRPV1 inactivation [A19725]. 
Tachyphylaxis or persistent desensitization is reversible, and involves the downregulation of proalgesic substances (such as SP) and upregulation of analgesic peptides [A19720]. "

It is believed that copper is reduced to the Cu1+ form prior to transport. Once inside the enterocyte, it is bound to copper transport protein ATOX1 which shuttles the ion to copper transporting ATPase-1 on the golgi membrane which take up copper into the golgi apparatus. Once copper has been secreted by enterocytes into the systemic circulation it remain largely bound by ceruloplasmin (65-90%), albumin (18%), and alpha 2-macroglobulin (12%). 

Copper is an essential element in the body and is incorporated into many oxidase enzymes as a cofactor [A19518]. It is also a component of zinc/copper super oxide dismutase, giving it an anti-oxidant role. Copper defiency occurs in Occipital Horn Syndrome and Menke's disease both of which are associated with impaired development of connective tissue due to the lack of copper to act as a cofactor in protein-lysine-6-oxidase. Menke's disease is also associated with progressive neurological impairment leading to death in infancy.

When used for the treatment or prevention of toxicity associated with fluorouracil and other antimetabolites, uridine triacetate is utilized for its ability to compete with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) metabolites for incorporation into the genetic material of non-cancerous cells. It reduces toxicity and cell-death associated with two cytotoxic intermediates: 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine-5'-monophosphate (FdUMP) and 5-fluorouridine triphosphate (FUTP).  By pre-administering with uridine (as the prodrug uridine triacetate), higher doses of 5-FU can be given allowing for improved efficacy and a reduction in toxic side effects [A18578] such as neutropenia, mucositis, diarrhea, and hand–foot syndrome. 

Uridine triacetate is also used for replacement therapy in the treatment of hereditary orotic aciduria, also known as uridine monophosphate synthase (UMPS) deficiency. As a result of UMPS deficiency, patients experience a  systemic deficiency of pyrimidine nucleotides, accounting for most symptoms of the disease.

Citrate is a weak base and so reacts with hydrochloric acid in the stomach to raise the pH.

Helium increases the coronary collateral circulation and enhances the vasodilatory effects of inhaled nitric oxide on pulmonary vessels. It is suggested to possess neuroprotective properties.

DB09166,Etizolam,CHEMBL1289779,"Etizolam is selectively a full agonist at GABA-A receptors to increase GABAergic transmission and enhance GABA-induced Cl- currents [A19771].

Benzodiazapines are reported to only bind to receptors that contain gamma 2 and alpha 1/2/3/5 subunits [T28]. Alpha-1-containing receptors mediate the sedative effects of etizolam whereas alpha-2 and alpha-3 subunit-containing receptors mediate the anxiolytic effect [T28]. Etizolam shows high potency and affinity towards GABA-A receptor with alpha 1 beta 2 gamma 2S subunit combination [A19771]. By binding to the regulatory site of the receptor, etizolam potentiates GABA transmission by facilitating the opening of GABA-induced chloride channels [T28].

It is shown that the main metabolite northiaden is a more potent inhibitor of noradrenaline uptake than the parent drug [A19758]. 

Dosulepin displays affinity towards α2-adrenoceptors and to a lesser extent, α1-adrenoceptors [A6584]. Inhibition of presynaptic α2-adrenoceptors by dosulepin facilitates noradrenaline release and further potentiates the antidepressant effects [A19758]. It also downregulates central β-adrenoceptors by causing a decline in the number of receptors and reduces noradrenaline-induced cyclic AMP formation [L881, A19758]. 
Dosulepin binds to 5HT1A and 5HT2A receptors in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus as an antagonist. 5HT1A receptors are autoreceptors that inhibit 5HT release and 5HT2A receptors are Gi/Go-coupled receptors that reduces dopamine release upon activation [T28]. Antagonism at 5HT2A receptors may also improve sleep patterns. Dosulepin also binds to muscarinic acetylcholine receptors and causes antimuscarinic side effects such as dry mouth. By acting as an antagonist at histamine type 1 (H1) receptors, dosulepin mediates a sedative effect. 

Main metabolites northiaden, dothiepin sulphoxide and northiaden sulphoxide may also bind to 5HT, α2 and H1 receptors, although with less affinity compared to the parent drug [A19755]."

Based on drug resistance mapping studies of HCV genotypes 1a and 1b, dasabuvir targets the palm domain of the NS5B polymerase, and is therefore referred to as a non-nucleoside NS5B-palm polymerase inhibitor. The EC50 values of dasabuvir against genotype 1a-H77 and 1b-Con1 strains in HCV replicon cell culture assays were 7.7 nM and 1.8 nM, respectively.

 By binding to NS5b outside of the active site of the enzyme, dasabuvir induces a conformational change thereby preventing further elongation of the nascent viral genome [A19593, FDA Label]. A limitation of binding outside of the active site is that these binding sites are poorly preserved across the viral genotypes. This results in a limited potential for cross-genotypic activity and increased potential for development of resistance. Dasabuvir is therefore limited to treating genotypes 1a and 1b, and must be used in combination with other antiviral products. "

Anti-inflammatory action comes from decreased prostaglandin E2 and prostacyclin leading to decreased vasodilation and oedema that enhances vascular permeability and activity of inflammatory mediators.

DB09220,Nicorandil,CHEMBL284906,"Nicorandil mediates its therapeutic efficacy via two main mechanisms. Nicorandil is an activator and opener of ATP-sensitive (ATP-dependent) potassium channels (KATP channels) that are composed of Kir6.x-type subunits and sulfonylurea receptor (SUR) subunits. Nicorandil binding sites are located in the sulfonylurea receptor 2 (SUR2) in the ATP-sensitive potassium channel [A20322], which are regulatory subunits of the channel that exhibit an ATPase activitiy [A12436]. There are 2 types of SUR2 subunits (2A/2B) that have identical nucleotide binding domains (NBD), where SUR2A is more predominantly expressed in skeletal and cardiac myocytes and SUR2B in smooth muscle cells [A12436]. Nicorandil more potently activates SUR2B/Kir6.2 than SUR2A/Kir6.2 channels to cause hyperpolarization. ATP-NBD1 interaction influences the channel signalling by nicorandil, and the response of the channel to nicorandil is also facilitated and heightened by the interaction of ATP or ADP with NBD2 [A20321]. Potentiated activity of ATP-sensitive channels have cardioprotective role by limiting the duration of action potentials and preventing intraceullar calcium overload [A20326]. This attenuates cellular injury by preserving cellular energetics and ultimately cell survival [A20324]. KATP channel-dependent membrane hyperpolarization can also lead to vasodilation via reduction in Ca2+ influx through the voltage-gated Ca2+ channels and regulation of intracellular Ca2+ mobilization in smooth muscle cells [A20324]. 
Nicorandil contain a nitrate moiety in its structure, making it a good dilator of vascular smooth muscle like other nitroglycerin esters [A20323]. Direct relaxation of venous vascular system arises from NO-donor mediated stimulation of guanylyl cyclase and increased levels of intracellular cyclic GMP (cGMP). Elevated levels of cGMP contributes to the total relaxing effect of nicorandil at higher concentrations of the drug [A7839]. "

DB09222,Fibrinogen Human,,"Fibrinogen (factor I) is a soluble plasma glycoprotein with a molecular weight of about 340 kDa. The native molecule is a dimer and consists of three pairs of polypeptide chains (Aα, Bβ and γ). Fibrinogen is a physiological substrate of three enzymes: thrombin, factor XIIIa, and plasmin. During the coagulation process, thrombin cleaves the Aα and Bβ chains releasing fibrinopeptides A and B (FPA and FPB, respectively). FPA is separated rapidly and the remaining molecule is a soluble fibrin monomer (fibrin I). The slower removal of FPB results in formation of fibrin II that is capable of polymerization that occurs by aggregation of fibrin monomers. The resulting fibrin is stabilized in the presence of calcium ions and by activated factor XIII, which acts as a transglutaminase. Factor XIIIa-induced cross-linking of fibrin polymers renders the fibrin clot more elastic and more resistant to fibrinolysis. Cross-linked fibrin is the end result of the coagulation cascade, and provides tensile strength to a primary hemostatic platelet plug and structure to the vessel wall."

C1 esterase inhibitor has also been shown to inhibit the action of thrombin within the coagulation pathway, and tPA and plasmin within the fibrinolytic pathway. Deficiency of C1-inhibitor permits plasma kallikrein activation, which leads to the production of the vasoactive peptide bradykinin. Additionally, C4 and C2 cleavage goes unchecked, resulting in auto-activation of the complement system. Down-stream effects of the lack of enzyme inhibition by C1 esterase inhibitor results in swelling due to leakage of fluid from blood vessels into connective tissue and consequently the presentation of hereditary angioedema (HAE).

Molecules with large volume of distribution, thus likely having higher lipid solubility, tends to bind have better absorptive binding to activated charcoal. Following the administration of activated charcoal, cathartics are indicated to evacuate the charcoal-poison bonded complex from the gastrointestinal tract. 
Activated charcoal may also have an effect on systemic drug levels by lowering the serum levels of already absorbed drugs or toxins. Many absorbed drugs that undergo significant hepatic metabolism and conjugation are eliminated via bile into the small intestines. When they reach the small intestines, drug conjugates can undergo hydrolysis and return to the enterohepatic circulation. Activated charcoal interferes with this process and binds to the conjugated drug before hydrolysis or the free deconjugated drug before reabsorption. "

The reduction in platelet activation is likely responsible for the decrease in thromboxane A2 generation seen with trapidil [A19760]. The increase in cAMP is also likely responsible for the vasdilatory action of trapidil. The increase in protein kinase A activity due to increased cAMP activated L-type calcium channels in the heart leading to increased depolarization and a positive inotropic effect [A19761, A19764]. Lastly, PKA inactivates Raf-1, an activator of mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK), which leads to a reduction in MAPK activation.

ANP and BNP are released under atrial and ventricle stress, which activate downstream receptors leading to vasodilation, natriuresis and diuresis. Under normal conditions, neprilysin breaks down other vasodilating peptides and also vasoconstrictors such as angiotensin I and II, endothelin-1 and peptide amyloid beta-protein. Therefore, the inhibition of neprilysin leads to reduced breakdown and increased concentration of endogenous natriuretic peptides in addition to increased levels of vasoconstricting hormones such as angiotensin II. (However, when combined with valsartan, would result in  blocking of angiotensin II to its receptor, preventing the vasoconstrictive effects and resulting in a decrease in vascular resistance and blood pressure.)  Cardiovascular and renal effects of sacubitril is a result of the increased levels of peptides that are normally degraded by neprilysin. "

PCSK9 is secreted by the liver and typically binds to the LDL receptors in serum and marks them for lysosomal degradation. In result, the LDL receptors are not able to recycle to the plasma membrane, reducing their binding to LDL-C and therefore reducing the clearance of LDL-C from plasma. Therefore by inhibiting PCSK9's actions, alirocumab allows for more LDL-C reuptake by the liver and facilitates a higher rate of clearance. Lower LDL cholesterol concentrations are associated with a reduced risk of coronary heart disease."
DB09303,Evolocumab,CHEMBL2364655,"Evolocumab is a human IgG monoclonal antibody which targets PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9). PCSK9 is a serine protease produced by the liver which binds LDL receptors and creates a complex to be targeted for lysosomal degradation. LDL receptors typically bind LDL-cholesterol (""bad"" cholesterol) for cellular reuptake, therefore the formation of these complexes with PCSK9 inhibits LDL receptor recycling to the cell surface, resulting in decreased cellular reuptake of LDL-C and increased levels of free LDL-C in the plasma. Individuals with familial hypercholesterolemia often may have ""gain of function"" mutations in the PCSK9 molecules in their body, resulting in increased LDL-C plasma levels and a consequent cardiovascular risk. Evolocumab is able to bind both the normal PCSK9 and the ""gain of function"" mutant, D374Y. The exact mechanism of the binding has not been published, however the precursor molecule, mAb1, is indicative of the interaction. The mAb1 molecule binds on the catalytic site of PCSK9 next to the binding site for the LDL receptor and creates hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions, resulting in the steric inhibition of binding between PCSK9 and the LDL receptor. Because the formation of complexes between LDL receptor and PCSK9 are prevented, the internalized LDL receptors are less likely to be degrated by lysosomes and may recycle to the surface of the cell to serve their function of removing LDL from the blood.

The addition of the high-energy phosphate group activates glucose for subsequent breakdown in later steps of glycolysis and is the rate-limiting step. Products end up as substrates for following reactions, to ultimately convert C6 glucose molecule into two C3 sugar molecules. These products enter the energy-releasing phase where total of 4ATP and 2NADH molecules are generated per one glucose molecule.

Propoxyphene primarily affects OP3 receptors, which are coupled with G-protein receptors and function as modulators, both positive and negative, of synaptic transmission via G-proteins that activate effector proteins. Binding of the opiate stimulates the exchange of GTP for GDP on the G-protein complex. As the effector system is adenylate cyclase and cAMP located at the inner surface of the plasma membrane, opioids decrease intracellular cAMP by inhibiting adenylate cyclase. Subsequently, the release of nociceptive neurotransmitters such as substance P, GABA, dopamine, acetylcholine, and noradrenaline is inhibited. Opioids such as propoxyphene also inhibit the release of vasopressin, somatostatin, insulin, and glucagon.

Magnesium-containing laxatives cause diarrhea through water retention and increased fecal mass that stimulates peristalsis. When used as an electrolyte supplementation, magnesium acetate tetrahydrate induces diuresis and metabolic alkalinizing effect. Magnesium ions enhance reactivity of arteries to vasoconstrictors, promotes vasoconstriction, and increases peripheral resistance, leading to increased blood pressure [A19412] through potential competition with calcium ions in the vascular system. Magnesium ions also regulate other ions entering and exiting the cell membrane by acting as a ligand in N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor."
DB09413,Monopotassium phosphate,CHEMBL1200925,"hosphorus has a number of important functions in the biochemistry of the body. The bulk of the body's phosphorus is located in the bones, where it plays a key role in osteoblastic and osteoclastic activities. Enzymatically catalyzed phosphate-transfer reactions are numerous and vital in the metabolism of carbohydrate, lipid and protein, and a proper concentration of the anion is of primary importance in assuring an orderly biochemical sequence. ln addition, phosphorus plays an important role in modifying steady-state tissue concentrations of calcium. Phosphate ions are important buffers of the intracellular fluid, and also play a primary role in the renal excretion of the hydrogen ion. Oral administration of inorganic phosphates increases serum phosphate levels. Phosphates lower urinary calcium levels in idiopathic hypercalciuria."

The most common mechanism of action for energy production derived from fatty acid metabolism is beta oxidation. Fatty acids are also important for membrane structure and function, precursors for bioactive molecules (such as prostaglandins), and as regulators of gene expression. Soybean oil-based lipid emulsion may also cause an increase in heat production, decrease in respiratory quotient, and increase in oxygen consumption following its administration [L855]. Soybean oil contents prevent abnormally high triacylglycerol synthesis and its accumulation as lipid droplets in the liver by regulating hepatic lipogenesis and lipolysis. In vitro, soybean oil is shown to prevent downregulation of CYP2C2, CYP2C11 and CYP3A2 mRNA thus maintaining hepatic drug oxidation capabilities. Soybean oil is broken down into free fatty acids that activate PPAR-alpha, which regulate hepatic CYP4A1 that hydroxylate saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. Soybean oil is also shown to prevent up/downregulation of efflux transporters and maintain mRNA levels of hepatic antioxidant enzymes in vitro rat studies [A19591]. "

DB09499,Thiosulfuric acid,CHEMBL1208642,"As antidote: Sodium thiosulfate acts as a sulfur donor for the endogenous sulfur transferase enzyme, rhodanese. It is used together with sodium nitrite for cyanide poisiong as antidote. Cyanide has a very high affinity for iron in the ferric state. It reacts with the trivalent (ferric) iron of mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase, thereby inhibiting cellular respiration, resulting in lactic acidosis and cytotoxic hypoxia. Sodium nitrite reacts with hemoglobin to form methemoglobin, which competes with cytochrome oxidase for the cyanide ion. Cyanide binds to methemoglobin to form cyanmethemoglobin and restore the activity of cytochrome oxidase. When cyanide dissociates from methemoglobin, sodium thiosulfate facilitates its conversion by rhodanese to thiocyanate, a less toxic ion. 
As antineoplastic adjunct: The mechanism of action of sodium thiosulfate is still not clear, but it is thought that it forms a complex with cisplastin via covalent bond, which renders cisplastin more readily eliminated from the kidneys. It was believed also that sodium thiosulfate plays a role in the protection from nephrotoxicity caused by cisplastin, through reducing delivery of cisplatin to the kidneys and by neutralizing cisplatin in the kidneys where sodium thiosulfate is highly concentrated.

Fludeoxyglucose F 18 is transported through the cell membrane by facilitative glucose transporter proteins and is phosphorylated within the cell to [18F] FDG-6- phosphate by the enzyme hexokinase. Once phosphorylated it cannot exit until it is dephosphorylated by glucose-6-phosphatase. Therefore, within a given tissue or pathophysiological process, the retention and clearance of Fludeoxyglucose F 18 reflect a balance involving glucose transporter, hexokinase and glucose-6- phosphatase activities. When allowance is made for the kinetic differences between glucose and Fludeoxyglucose F 18 transport and phosphorylation (expressed as the “lumped constant” ratio), Fludeoxyglucose F 18 is used to assess glucose metabolism.
In comparison to background activity of the specific organ or tissue type, regions of decreased or absent uptake of Fludeoxyglucose F 18 reflect the decrease or absence of glucose metabolism.

As the urease enzyme is not present in mammalian cells, the presence of urease (and the products of urea cleavage) in the stomach is evidence that H. pylori bacteria are present.  To detect H. pylori, urea labeled with 13C is swallowed by the patient. If gastric urease from H. pylori is present, urea is split to form CO2 and NH3 at the interface between the gastric epithelium and lumen and 13CO2 is absorbed into the blood and exhaled in the breath.

If gastric urease from H. pylori is present, urea is split to form CO2 and NH3 at the interface between the gastric epithelium and lumen and 14CO2 is absorbed into the blood and exhaled in the breath.
Following ingestion of the capsule by a patient with H. pylori, 14CO2 excretion in the breath peaks between 10 and 15 minutes and declines thereafter with a biological half-life of about 15 minutes.

Specific changes found after immunotherapy with dust mite extracts include significant increases in mite-specific IgG4 antibodies, interleukin-10-positive T cells, and several T-cell receptors, and significant decreases in serum nitric oxide, eosinophil catonic protein, interleukin-4-positive T cells and IgE-mediated basophil histamine release."

It works by depositing a stable acid-resistant layer on the tooth surfaces which is composed of calcium fluoride produced when stannous fluoride converts the calcium mineral apatite into fluorapatite. Tin and fluoride mediate anti-erosive actions by interacting with and modifying the absorbent layer composed of salivary proteins such as mucins, perhaps by enhancing the cross-linking between the proteins to result in a more resistant and protective layer against erosion [A19580]. The efficacy of stannous fluoride solutions seems to depend mainly on the incorporation of tin in the mineralized dentine when the organic portion is preserved but on surface precipitation when the organic portion is continuously digested. Moreover, the relative erosion-inhibiting effects of stannous fluoride strongly depend on the presence or absence of the demineralized organic dentine matrix [A19596]."
DB11093,Calcium Citrate,CHEMBL2106123,"Calcium citrate increases plasma calcium levels. This reduces calcium flux from osteocyte activity by reducing the secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH) [T36]. Calcium does this by stimulating a G-protein coupled calcium receptor on the surface of parathyroid cells. The reduction in calcium flux increases the amount of calcium deposited in bone resulting in an increase in bone mineral density. The reduction in PTH secretion also reduces the amount of vitamin D metabolized to its active form, calcidiol. Since calcidiol increases the expression of calcium dependent ATPases and transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 6 (TRPV6) both of which are involved in calcium uptake from the gut, a reduction in calcidiol results in less calcium absorption. Additionally, TRPV5, the channel responsible for calcium reabsorption in the kidney, is downregulated when PTH secretion is reduced thus increasing calcium excretion via the kidneys. Another hormone, calitonin, is likely involved in the reduction of bone resorption during periods of high plasma calcium."

Also, calcium helps to regulate the release and storage of neurotransmitters and hormones, the uptake and binding of amino acids, absorption of vitamin B 12, and gastrin secretion. The major fraction (99%) of calcium is in the skeletal structure primarily as hydroxyapatite, Ca 10(PO 4) 6(OH) 2; small amounts of calcium carbonate and amorphous calcium phosphates are also present. The calcium of bone is in a constant exchange with the calcium of plasma. Since the metabolic functions of calcium are essential for life, when there is a disturbance in the calcium balance because of dietary deficiency or other causes, the stores of calcium in bone may be depleted to fill the body's more acute needs.

Eicosapentaenoic acids compete with constitutive levels of arachidonic acid in cell membranes for the same desaturation enzymes and produce 3-series prostaglandins and thromboxanes, and 5-series leukotrienes which have low pro-inflammatory potential. The alteration in leukotriene biosynthesis due to higher concentration of omega-3 fatty acids compared to arachidonic acid underlies the anti-inflammatory effects. 
EPA and DHA also give rise to resolvins and related lipid signalling molecules such as protectins via cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase pathways, which have anti-inflammatory effects. They inhibit transendothelial migration of neutrophils and inhibit TNF and IL-1β production. Omega-3 fatty acids also decrease adhesion molecule expression on leukocytes and on endothelial cells and decrease intercellular adhesive interactions.
Omega-3 (or n-3) polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and their metabolites are natural ligands for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) gamma that regulates inflammatory gene expression and NFκB activation. PPAR alpha activation is also associated with induction of COX-2 expression. 
The role of EPA and DHA in reducing triglyceride levels include inhibition of acyl-CoA:1,2-diacylglycerol acyltransferase, increased mitochondrial and peroxisomal-beta-oxidation in the liver, decreased lipogenesis in the liver, and increased plasma lipoprotein lipase activity. They also may reduce triglyceride synthesis because they are poor substrates for the enzymes responsible for TG synthesis, and EPA and DHA inhibit esterification of other fatty acids. "

This sequence is recognized by RNA ste loop structures called selenocysteine inserting sequences (SECIS). These structures require the binding of SECIS binding proteins (SBP-2) to recognize selenocystiene. The specialized tRNA is first bound to a serine residue which is then enzymatically processed to a selylcysteyl-tRNA by selenocystiene sythase using selenophosphate as a selenium donor. Other unidentified proteins are required as part of the binding of this tRNA to the ribosome. Selenoproteins appear to be necessary for life as mice with the specialized tRNA gene knocked out exhibited early embryonic lethality [A19379].

The most important selenoproteins seem to be the glutathione peroxidases and thioredoxin reductases which are part of the body's defenses againts reactive oxygen species (ROS) [A19375]. The importance of selenium in these anti-oxidant proteins has been implicated in the reduction of atherosclerosis by preventing the oxidation of low density lipoprotein [A19384] [A19380].

In toothpaste and in systemic circulation, calcium phosphate provides a source of calcium and phosphate ions to support remineralization of the teeth and bone homeostasis respectively. The increase in plasma calcium reduces calcium flux from osteocyte activity by reducing the secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH) [T36]. Calcium does this by stimulating a G-protein coupled calcium receptor on the surface of parathyroid cells. The reduction in calcium flux increases the amount of calcium deposited in bone resulting in an increase in bone mineral density. The reduction in PTH secretion also reduces the amount of vitamin D metabolized to its active form, calcidiol. Since calcidiol increases the expression of calcium dependent ATPases and transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 6 (TRPV6) both of which are involved in calcium uptake from the gut, a reduction in calcidiol results in less calcium absorption. Additionally, TRPV5, the channel responsible for calcium reabsorption in the kidney, is downregulated when PTH secretion is reduced thus increasing calcium excretion via the kidneys.

Deficient LAL enzyme activity results in progressive complications due to the lysosomal accumulation of cholesteryl esters and triglycerides in multiple organs, including the liver, spleen, intestine, and the walls of blood vessels. The resulting lipid accumulation in the liver may lead to increased liver fat content and progression of liver disease, including fibrosis and cirrhosis. Lipid accumulation in the intestinal wall leads to malabsorption and growth failure. In parallel, dyslipidemia due to impaired degradation of lysosomal lipid is common with elevated LDL-c and triglycerides and low HDL-cholesterol (HDL-c). Sebelipase alfa binds to cell surface receptors via glycans expressed on the protein and is subsequently internalized into lysosomes. Sebelipase alfa catalyzes the lysosomal hydrolysis of cholesteryl esters and triglycerides to free cholesterol, glycerol and free fatty acids. "

DB11596,Levoleucovorin,CHEMBL1908841,"Folic acid is an essential B vitamin required by the body for the synthesis of purines, pyrimidines, and methionine before incorporation into DNA or protein. However, in order to function in this role, it must first be reduced by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) into the cofactors dihydrofolate (DHF) and tetrahydrofolate (THF). This important pathway, which is required for de novo synthesis of nucleic acids and amino acids, is disrupted when high-dose methotrexate is used for cancer therapy. As methotrexate functions as a DHFR inhibitor to prevent DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing cells, it also prevents the formation of DHF and THF. This results in a deficiency of coenzymes and a resultant buildup of toxic substances that are responsible for numerous adverse side effects of methotrexate therapy. As levoleucovorin and leucovorin are analogs of tetrahydrofolate (THF), they are able to bypass DHFR reduction and act as a cellular replacement for the co-factor THF, thereby preventing these toxic side effects."
DB11597,Human Rho(D) immune globulin,,"The mechanism of action of Rho(D) immune globulin therapy is unclear. It is suggested that Rho immune globulin predominantly prevents the antibody response during incompatible pregnancy by accelerating the phagocytosis of RBC's and clearance from the circulation before the recognition by the immune system. IgG-opsonized RBCs may interact with activating IgG receptors (FcγRs) on effector cells and elicit phagocytosis via mononuclear phagocytic system, primarily by macrophages. IgG may also stimulate complement activation on the RBC surface, followed by RBC lysis or complement receptor-mediated phagocytosis but to smaller extent [A19522]. Rho-specific IgG may inhibit the late stages of B cell activation by being internalized with Rho antigen by B cells, which alters the antigen processing and presentation. In response to the IgG-antigen complex formation, the immune globulin enhances the presentation of specific peptides and proliferation of epitope-specific T cells [A19522]. 
Therapeutic efficacy of Rho (D) immune globulin in chronic immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) may be explained by FcR blockade as well as the increase in the platelet count by substituting antibody-coated RBCs for antibodycoated platelets [A19519]. In vitro studies of cytokine expression in human monocytes and granulocytes exposed to anti-D coated red blood cells have demonstrated enhanced secretion of interleukin 1 receptor antagonist resulting in down-regulation of FcγR mediated phagocytosis. Murine models show that RBC-specific antibodies can increase platelet counts by down-regulating FcγRIIIa on splenic macrophage, which is an opposing effect as predicted in intravenous Rho IgG [A19521]. "
DB11598,Antithrombin III human,,"Antithrombin, an alpha2-glycoprotein of molecular weight 58,000, is normally present in human plasma at a concentration of approximately 12.5 mg/dL and is the major plasma inhibitor of thrombin. Inactivation of thrombin by AT occurs by formation of a covalent bond resulting in an inactive 1:1 stoichiometric complex between the two, involving an interaction of the active serine of thrombin and an arginine reactive site on AT. AT is also capable of inactivating other components of the coagulation cascade including factors IXa, Xa, XIa, and XIIa, as well as plasmin. The neutralization rate of serine proteases by AT proceeds slowly in the absence of heparin, but is greatly accelerated in the presence of heparin. As the therapeutic antithrombotic effect of heparin is mediated by AT, heparin in vivo is ineffective in the absence or near absence of AT.
After administration, Antithrombin III human temporarily replaces the missing AT in patients with hereditary antithrombin deficiency."

DB11601,Tuberculin Purified Protein Derivative,,"When exposed to *M. tuberculosis* antigen, the sensitization initiates in the regional lymph nodes where T lymphocytes proliferate in response to the antigenic stimulus to give rise to specifically sensitized lymphocytes which may exist in the circulation up to many years. Antigen is presented to T cells by being ingested by antigen presenting cells (APC), which then present it on their surface to lymphocytes in combination with various MHC molecules once they reach local lymph nodes [T28]. Tuberculin PPD most likely interacts with toll-like receptor 2 expressed on APCs that initiates an inflammatory response. Subsequent restimulation of these sensitized lymphocytes with the same or a similar antigen, such as the intradermal injection of tuberculin PPD, evokes a local reaction mediated by these cells. This reaction is referred to as a delayed-type hypersensitivity response that includes vasodilation, edema, and the infiltration of lymphocytes, basophils, monocytes, and neutrophils into the site of antigen injection. The sensitized antigen-specific T lymphocytes proliferate and release lymphokines, which mediate the accumulation of other cells at the site [L806]. In vitro studies show that Tuberculin PPD promotes the upregulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression in T lymphocytes through major histocompatibility (MHC) class II interaction with CD4+ T lymphocyte interaction [A19537]. The reactions are evident after 5-6 hours following administration. "

This affords time for the rabies vaccine, which is also administered in cases of rabies exposure, to induce an immune response to destroy the virus. Rabies immunoglobulin should only be administered up to eight days after exposure as the host begins to produce sufficient antibodies to the virus one week after exposure. Repeat dosing should also be avoided as it may interfere with induction of immune response by the rabies vaccine."
DB11604,Tetanus Immune Globulin,,"The immune globulin binds to tetanus toxiod, interfering with the normal interaction of the toxoid with human tissue. This prevents the toxoid from invading the nervous system and producing painful muscle spasms as well as autonomic dysfunction [A19535]. The Clostridium tetani bacterium is killed either via antibiotic treatment of the host's immune system and immune globulin-bound toxoid is likely broken down by phagocytic immune cells."
DB11605,Myrrh,,"**Anti-inflammatory:** Myrrh is thought to mediate its anti-inflammatory activity through inducing haem oxygenase activity [A19599]. Haem oxygenase then appears to prevent the degradation of IKBalpha in response to inflammatory receptor activation. This prevents translocation of nuclear factor kappaB (NFkappaB) to the nucleus and inhibits the expression of genes under its control like cyclooxygenase-2 and the inducible form of nitric oxide synthase. The suppression of the NFkappaB pathway likely also reduces the expression of inflammatory cytokines. Myrhh also inhibits the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, specifically producing inhibition of p38 and c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) [A19600]. This is associated with a reduction in c-jun and c-fos expression which would likely result in a reduction in activator protein-1 and and inhibition of its associated inflammatory gene expression. Myrrh exibits inhibitory activity against 5-lipoxygenase helping to suppress the production of leukotrienes, another class of inflammatory cytokine [A19601]. In addition to its effects on the NFkappaB system, myrrh also inhibits the signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) -1 and -3 resulting in a decrease in cytokine production by the janus kinase/STAT pathway [A19615]. Myrrh also reduces the downregulation of suppresor of cytokine synthesis (SOCS) in response to interleukin-1beta and interferon-gamma. SOCS serves as an autoregulator of the JAK/STAT pathway under transcriptional control of STATs and inhibits activation of the pathway.

**Analgesic:** Myrrh appears to produce an analgesic effect associated with its suppression of prostaglandin production [A19602]. Myrrh is also suggested to block inward sodium currents [A19618].

**Anticancer:** Myrrh displays an pro-apoptotic effect on cancer cells [A19598]. This seems to involve members of the Bcl family of proteins [A19603]. Myrrh induces the expression of the pro-apoptotic protein Bax while decreasing the expression of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl, the anti-apoptotic members of the Bcl family. At low doses Myrrh seems to activate the MAPK pathway in cancer cells, promoting the phosphorylation of p38 and JNK [A19604]. The JNK activation in particular appears to mediate an apoptotic influence. Additionally, myrrh appears to induce reactive oxygen species generation in cancer cells further promoting apoptosis.

**Antibacterial/Antiparasitic/Antifungal:** The precise antibacterial, antiparasitic, and antifungal mechanisms of myrrh are unknown [A19605, A19608].

**Hepatoprotective:** Myrrh has been shown to reduce liver injury and upregulation of superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase and catalase in response to carbon tetrachloride insult. This is thought to be due to anti-oxidant properties of myrrh [A19607]. 

**Antioxidant:** The precise mechanism of myrrh's antioxidant property is unknown.

**Lipid lowering:** Compounds in myrrh bind to and inhibit the farnesoid X receptor resulting in a reduction in low density lipoprotein [A19609]. This effect is likely to due the attenuation of the suppression of bile synthesis and a reduction in ileal bile acid binding protein in response to farnesoid X receptor stimulation [A19610]. Together these would ensure processing of cholesterol into bile and subsequent loss of that bile by reducing reuptake.

**Cardioprotective:** The exact mechanism of myrrh's cardioprotective effect is unknown.

**Antidiabetic:** Much of myrrh's antidiabetic action is attrbutable to it's anti-inflammatory action which protects islet beta cells from inflammatory damage during hyperglycemia [A19615]. The antioxidant properties of myrrh also likely contribute to this effect. 

**Antiulcer:** The antiulcer activity of myrrh is suggested to be due to inhibition of gastric acid secretion, increasing gastric mucus secretion, and myrrh's antioxidant properties [A19617].

LFA-1/ICAM-1 interaction can contribute to the formation of an immunological synapse resulting in T-cell proliferation/activation and migration to target tissues.

It acts to produce vascular leakage which contributes to rhinorhea and nasal blockage. By blocking both the H1 receptor and PAF receptor, rupatidine prevents these mediators from exerting their effects and so reduces the severity of allergic symptoms."

Lymphoma occurs when immune system lymphocytes grow and multiply uncontrollably. Such cancerous lymphocytes may travel to many parts of the body, including the lymph nodes, spleen, bone marrow, blood, and other organs where they can multiply and form a mass(es) called a tumor. One of the main kinds of lymphocytes that can develop into cancerous lymphomas are the body's own B-lymphocytes (B-cells) [L1008].

Both acalabrutinib and its active metabolite, ACP-5862, act to form a covalent bond with a cysteine residue (Cys481) in the BTK active site, leading to inhibition of BTK enzymatic activity [A31253, L1008]. As a result, acalabrutinib inhibits BTK-mediated activation of downstream signaling proteins CD86 and CD69, which ultimately inhibits malignant B-cell proliferation and survival [L1008].

DB12001,Abemaciclib,CHEMBL3301610,"Regulation of cell cycle is crucial in maintaining proper cell growth; dysregulated cell cycle signalling pathway is a key component in inducing hyperproliferation of cells and tumor formation in various cancers. G1 to S phase cell cycle progression, or transition through the G1 restriction point (R), is promoted by the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein (Rb)-mediated pathway. Activation of Rb-mediated pathway requires the interaction of Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK) 4 and 6 with D-type cyclins, which drives the formation of active CDK4/CDK6 and subsequent phosphorylation of Rb [A27281, A27282]. 

Rb is a tumor suppressant protein that inhibits proliferation through binding to and suppressing the activity of the E2F family of transcription factors [A27281]. However, phosphorylation of Rb relieves suppression of E2F to allow expression of genes required for passage through the restriction point [A27281]. This leads to increased expression of downstream signalling molecules and activity of protein kinases that promote the cell cycle progression and initiation of DNA replication. Phosphorylation of Rb and other proteins by CDK4/6 additionally leads to transcription of genes involved in cell cycle-independent activities including signal transduction, DNA repair transcriptional control, and mRNA processing [A27281]. 

Abemaciclib selectively inhibits CDK4 and CDK6 with low nanomolar potency, inhibits Rb phosphorylation resulting in a G1 arrest and inhibition of proliferation, and its activity is specific for Rb-proficient cells [A27281]. Unlike other CDK inhibitors such as [DB09073] and [DB11730], abemaciclib exhibits greater selectivity for CDK4 compared to CDK6 [A27282]. "

Mutational activation of MET has also been found in sporadic kidney cancer, lung carcinomas and head and neck carcinomas. MET is a key driver of tumor cell growth, motility, invasion, metastasis and angiogenesis. Foretinib has attractive pharmaceutical properties with high solubility and oral bioavailability and demonstrates nanomolar potency against its targets, VEGFR, MET, which translates to potent activity in cellular assays. In preclinical studies, Foretinib, developed as a balanced inhibitor of these receptor tyrosine kinases, potently inhibited both MET and VEGFR, including mutant activated forms of MET found in hereditary papillary renal carcinomas. The compound also demonstrated dose-dependent growth inhibition in tumor models of breast, colorectal, non-small cell lung cancer and glioblastoma and has been shown to cause substantial tumor regression in all models tested."

In vitro studies have shown that rucaparib-induced cytotoxicity may involve inhibition of PARP enzymatic activity and increased formation of PARP-DNA complexes resulting in DNA damage, apoptosis, and cell death. Increased rucaparib-induced cytotoxicity was observed in tumor cell lines with deficiencies in BRCA1/2 and other DNA repair genes. Rucaparib has been shown to decrease tumor growth in mouse xenograft models of human
cancer with or without deficiencies in BRCA. 
Rucaparib sensitise cancer cells to X-radiation or (131)I-meta-iodobenzylguanidine treatment.

In contrast, Bardoxolone in normal cells induces protective antioxidant/anti-inflammatory responses. Intensive research in animal models of human cancer has demonstrated that Bardoxolone is a potent anticancer agent with a well-characterized ability to inhibit growth and cause regression of tumors as a single agent and in combination with radiation and chemotherapy. Bardoxolone also suppresses radiation- and chemotherapy-induced damage (e.g., oral mucositis) in normal tissues at dose levels that also produce an anti-cancer effect. Bardoxolone induces apoptosis through both caspase-independent and -dependent mechanisms, the latter involving caspase-8 activation, Bid cleavage, cytochrome c release, and caspase-3 activation. Furthermore, JNK, p38, and ERK pathways are involved in Bardoxolone-induced apoptosis of tumor cell lines mediated by disrupted intracellular redox balance and involving decreased glutathione and increased reactive oxygen species. Study shows that Bardoxolone enhances p42 CEBPA protein at the level of translation. [A3973]"

Accordingly, inhibition of these receptors would be expected to increase renal blood flow and enhance diuresis. The effects of Rolofylline on renal function are consistent with those obtained with another adenosine A1-receptor antagonist in both experimental and human heart failure."

DB13145,Nedaplatin,,"As a platinum analog, nedaplatin likely works similarly to [DB00515] on which the following mechanistic description is based. Once it has entered the cell it is hydrolyzed to its active form which complexes with water molecules [A20304]. This form binds to to nucleophiles in the cytoplasm such as glutathione and other cyteine rich proteins resulting in an overall increase in oxidative stress as the cell loses antioxidant proteins. It also binds to purine nucleotides in the DNA. The active form allows for two binding interactions to form cross-links between these nucleotides. High mobility group proteins-1 and -2 induce apoptosis in response to guanine cross-links and their binding serves to shield the cross-linked DNA from repair mechanisms. The mismatch repair (MMR) protein complex also recognizes the distortion caused by platinum complexes and attempts to repair the DNA. This results in single strand breaks when the MMR complex attempts to remove the platinum cross-link. The MMR complex induces apoptosis after the repair attempt has failed. The single strand break in DNA makes it easier to form lethal double strand breaks with radiation treatment thus creating the radiosensitizing effect of nedaplatin [A20303]."

Factor  X  is  converted  from its  inactive  form  to  the  active  form  (Factor  Xa)  by  the  cleavage  of  a  52-residue  peptide  from  the  heavy  chain.  Factor  Xa  associates  with  Factor V a on a phospholipid surface to form the prothrombinase complex, which activates  prothrombin  to  thrombin  in  the  presence  of  calcium  ions.  Thrombin  then  acts  upon  soluble fibrinogen and Factor XIII to generate a cross-linked fibrin clot."
DB13149,Protein S human,,"Thrombin converts protein C to activated protein C (APC) [A19561]. Protein S functions as a cofactor for APC and together they proteolytically cleave factor Va and VIIIa [A19561] [A19562]. This inhibits the activities of the prothrombinase and tenase complexes respectively and leads to a reduction in thrombin generation. The reduction in thrombin generation suppresses the coagulation cascade preventing additional clotting from occuring. Protein S is suggested to inhibit factors Va and Xa through protein-protein interactions [A19565] [A19561]. Protein S is also suggested to inhibit production of factor Xa by the tenase complex by competing for binding to phospholipids via its gamma-carboxyglutamic acid domain.

Protein S is thought to exert an anti-inflammatory effect in addition to its anticoagulant properties. The protein S-C4b-binding protein complex is believed to bind to phosphotidylserines on the cell membranes of apoptotic cells and interact with macrophages, signalling them to phagocytose the cell before it can rupture [A19564]."
DB13150,Coagulation factor VII human,,Factor VII is required in the extrinsic clotting cascade.

Endogenous and FEIBA contained thrombin then cleave fibrinogen to insulouble fibrin and activate factor XIII which covalently cross-links fibrin to form a polymer mesh. FEIBA also contains factor IX and IXa which act as part of the tenase complex to convert factor X to Xa. Thrombin activates factor V, VII, and VIII as part of the amplification phase of the clotting cascade. These events promote the formation of blood clots to prevent or stop bleeding. "
DB13152,Coagulation Factor IX Human,,"Coagulation Factor IX is an important protein in the process of hemostasis and normal blood clotting as it plays a key role within the coagulation cascade. It is located within the blood plasma as a zymogen, an antecedent to enzymatic function, in its inactivated state. Factor IX is dependent on the presence of Vitamin K, and is activated to a serine protease by the function of Coagulation Factor XIa. Factor XIa cleaves the peptide bond associated with protein activation in Factor IX, leaving Factor IX with two exposed chains, a light chain and a heavy chain. These two chains are held together by several disulfide bonds that reinforce the structure of Factor IX's activated form. After being activated, Factor IX forms a complex with calcium ions, membrane phospholipids and Coagulation Factor VIII to activate Coagulation Factor X. The activation of Factor X then performs a similarly integral step in the blood coagulation cascade. The ultimate result of phenotypically normal coagulation factors is the creation of platelets for normal blood clotting."

Using in vitro assays and studies in transgenic animal models of SMA, nusinersen was shown to increase exon 7 inclusion in SMN2 messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) transcripts and production of full-length SMN protein. 
Nusinersen acts to replace the SMN protein deficit which causes SMA, by increasing the splicing efficiency of the SMN2 pre- mRNA. More specifically, nusinersen in an 18-mer 2’-MOE phosphorothioate antisense oligonucleotide that acts as a splice-altering oligonucleotide. Nusinersen was designed to pair with a specific target sequence on the SMN2 pre-mRNA to displace heterogeneous ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs) at the intronic splice silencing site-1 (ISS-1) between exons 7 and 8 to allow for more complete translation of SMN protein from the paralogous gene SMN2.
Further reinforcing this concept, SMA phenotype is closely tied to SMN2 copy number. SMN2 serves to produce SMN protein, however at a greatly reduced rate because of differential splicing caused by the binding of the hnRNPs at the ISS-1."

DB13165,Ripasudil,CHEMBL3426621,"Ripasudil is a highly selective and potent Rho-associated coiled/coil-containing kinase protein (ROCK) inhibitor. Rho-kinase (ROCK) is an effector protein of Rho which binds with Rho to form a Rho/Rho-kinase complex. This complex then regulates many physiological functions including smooth muscle contractions, chemotaxis, neural growth and gene expression. ROCK comes in 2 isoforms: ROCK-1 and ROCK-2 and these two isoforms are distributed widely in our tissues including ocular tissues such as the iris, retina, trabecular meshwork and ciliary muscles. Atypical regulation of ROCK levels is involved in the pathogenesis of diseases such as glaucoma, ocular hypertension, cataracts and other retinal disorders.

Ripasudil acts as very highly selective and potent inhibitor with an IC50 of Ripasudil with ROCK-1 of 0.051 umol/L and with ROCK-2 of 0.019 umol/L. ROCK inhibitors have efficacy in reducing IOP by acting on the trabecular meshwork in the eye directly to increase conventional outflow through the Schlemm’s canal. Ripasudil will inhibit ROCK and induce cytoskeletal changes including the retraction and rounding of cell bodies and cause disruption of actin bundles in this trabecular meshwork. This can reduce the compaction of trabecular meshwork tissue and eventually result in increased aqueous outflow in the eye and reduced resistance to fluid flow.

Thus, Ripasudil is effective by inducing cytoskeletal changes which are depending on ROCK inhibition. Ripasudil decreases IOP by increasing outflow facility along with modulating the behavior of trabecular meshwork cells and Schlemm’s canal endothelial (SCE) cell permeability along with a disruption of the tight junction. 

When Ripasudil is used in combination with prostaglandin analogues it results in increased uveoscleral outflow and when used in combination with beta blockers it results in reduced aqueous production.

The initial rate limiting desaturation of LA to GLA is catalysed by the enzyme delta-6-desaturase (FADS2) and elongation of GLA to DGLA by delta-5-desaturase (FADS1) generates AA [A19374]. AA is also converted to 2-series prostaglandins (PGD2, PGE2, PGF2, PGI2) andthromboxanes (TXA2, TXB2) by COX-2 activity and 4-series leukotrienes (LTA4, LTB4, LTC4, LTD4, LTE4) by 5-LOX activity. Resulting lipid signalling molecules have various pro-inflammatory effects on target tissues and cells; bronchostriction, fever, pain, increased production of inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-alpha and IL-6, platelet aggregation, vasoconstriction, vascular permeability, chemotaxis of leukocytes, and release of reactive oxygen species by granulocytes [A19374]. 
Omega-6 fatty acids activate PPAR to the less extent than omega-3 fatty acids, but a study involving human keratinocytes showed induction of COX-2 expression resulting from PPAR-alpha activation. Omega-6 fatty acids are also reported to directly activate syntaxin-3, a plasma protein membrane that regulates vesicle transport and growth of neurites [A19387]. "

Plecanatide and its active metabolite bind to GC-C and act locally on the luminal surface of intestinal epithelial cells; GC-C activation leads to increased cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), which, in turn, stimulates secretion of chloride and bicarbonate into the intestinal lumen, mainly by activation of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) ion channel, resulting in increased intestinal fluid and accelerated transit.
 In animal models, plecanatide has been shown to increase fluid secretion into the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, accelerate intestinal transit, and cause changes in stool consistency.
In an animal model of visceral pain, plecanatide reduced abdominal muscle contractions, a measure of intestinal pain. The mechanism has not been studied. "

DB13174,Rhein,CHEMBL418068,"**Liver: **The reversal of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease stems from rhien's lipid lowering and anti-obesity actions which result in an overall decrease in body weight, high density lipoprotein, and low density lipoprotein as well as its anti-inflammatory action [A19303]. The reversal of hepatic fibrosis is thought to be due to rhien's anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant action which suppresses the pro-fibrotic signalling from macrophages and further damage from reactive oxygen species respectively [A19304]. Ultimately this results in reduced expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin (Alpha-SMA) which is indicative of decreased hepatic stellate cell and myofibroblast activation. Rhein also appears to suppress the expression of transforming growth factor-Beta (TGF-Beta) 

**Kidney: **The protection from fibrosis in the kidney also appears to stem from rhien's anti-inflammatory action resulting in less inflammatory cell infiltration along with suppression of alpha-SMA and fibronectin expression [A19307]. These indicate a reduction in the activation of interstitial fibroblasts which are responsible for excess production of extracellular matrix components. Rhien may also suppress TGF-beta expression in the kidney. The anti-fibrotic mechanism of rhien may involve the upregulation of bone morphogenetic protein 7 and hepatic growth factor [A19308]. In diabetic nephropathy rhein appears to suppress the expression of integrin-linked kinase leading to a reduction in the matrix metalloproteinase-9/tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase-1 ratio [A19311]. The improvement of epithelial tight junction function seems to involve upregulation of zona occludins protein-1 and occludin expression [A19310].

**Bone and joint:**Rhein reduces cartilage destruction by decreasing expression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-1 and -3 as well as upregulating tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinases which serve to reduce the activity of several MMPs [A19339]. The anti-inflammatory action of rhein reduces the level of interleukin-1beta activity which plays a large role in reduction of extracellular matrix production, MMP activity, and continued inflammation [A19338]. Rhein reduces abnormal osteoblast synthetic activity through an unknown mechanism [A19337].

**Lipid lowering and anti-obesity: **Rhein is known to bind and inhibit liver X receptor alpha and beta with Kd values of 46.7 microM and 31.97 microM respectively [A19315]. This decreases the expression of genes such as that of sterol regulatory element binding transcription factor 1 (SREBP1c) and its downstream genes for fatty acid synthase (FAS), steroyl-coenzyme A desaturase 1 (SCD1), and acetyl CoA carboxylase 1 (ACC1). SREBP1c, FAS, SCD1, and ACC1 are all involved in adipogenesis and their suppression results in less fat content. The genes for ABCA1 and ABCG1 are also suppressed. These correspond to cholesterol efflux trasporters and likely explain the reductiion in HDL and LDL seen with rhein. The inhibition of LXR by rhien relieves the inhibition on uncoupling protein 1 expression in brown adipose tissue. The result of this is increased thermogenesis which likely plays a role in the reduction of body weight produced by rhien. Additionally, rhein may downregulate peroxisome proliferator-receptor gamma and its downstream genes to inhibit adipocyte differentiation [A19314].

**Anti-oxidant/Pro-oxidant:** The antoxidant mechanism is unknown. The pro-oxidant action of rhien may involve the inhibition of mitochondrial respiratory complex 1 and subsequent facilitation of NADH and NADPH dependent lipid peroxidation [A19323].

**Anti-cancer:** The exact mechanism of rhein's ability to damage DNA and supress the expression of DNA repair enzymes ADR and MGMT is unknown [A19340]. The mechanism through which rhien induces ER stress is unknown but likely involves its pro-oxidant properties [A19341]. Rhein has been observed to produce increases in cytosolic calcium, reductions in mitochondrial membrane potential, and upregulation of pro-apoptotic proteins as well as leakage of cytochrome C which would induce apoptosis via the intrinsic pathway. The reduction of matrix metalloproteinase-9 serves to prevent extra cellular matrix breakdown by cancer cells and hinders their invasion into surrounding tissue [A19342]. Rhein also decreases vascular endothelial growth factor expression through an unknown mechanism to prevent cancer cells from stimulating agiogenesis. Rhein reduces the activity of the nuclear factor kappa (NFkappaB) pathway by preventing the destruction of IKBalpha [A19342] [A19345]. The activity of the phosphoinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathway is also reduced by rhien [A19343]. Rhein's inhibition of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways (particularly those involving extracellular signal regulated kinase) appears to follow a U-shaped dose response curve. ERK phosphorylation is inhibited at low concentrations of around 3microM but activated at higher concentrations of around 30microM [A19344]. Furthermore, ERK phosporylation is again inhibited at extremely high concentrations in excess of 100 microM [A19342]. The suppression of these three pathways is likely involved in the anti-proliferative effects of rhein.

**Anti-inflammatory:** The mechanism of rhein's anti-inflammatory effect likely involves its inhibition of the NFkappa B pathway which plays a role in the production of many pro-inflammatory cytokines [A19342] [A19345]. Rhein's anti-oxidant activity may also play a role in preventing damage during inflammation.

**Anti-diabetic:** Rhein is thought to increase islet beta cell survival by suppressing the expression of dynamin-related protein 1 and thereby preventing mitochondrial fission [A19288]. Rhein's anti-oxidant properties are also thought to play a role in protecting islet beta cells. The reduction in plasma glucose is likely due to increased survival of islet beta cells and subsequent increases in insulin secretion. Rhein's anti-inflammatory action may also serve to reduce insulin resistance.

**Anti-microbial:** Rhien inhibits H. pylori arylamine N-acetyltransferase in a dose dependent manner [A19312]. The mechanism of rhein's anti-microbial effect on H. pylori and S. aureus are unknown.

**Anti-allergenic:** Rhien inhibits 5-lipoxygenase with an IC50 of 13.7microM [A19329]. Rhien also inhibits mast cell degranulation although the specific mechanism is unknown."
DB13175,Rheinanthrone,CHEMBL421615,Rheinanthrone appears to increase macrophage expression of cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2) which increases production of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) [A19235]. This increase in PGE2 is associated with a subsequent decrease in aquaporin 3 expression. The decreased expression of aquaporin 3 likely restricts reabsorption of water in the large intestine resulting in the laxative effect of rheinanthrone. Rheinanthrone also appears to stimulate peristalsis in the large intestine dependent on contact with the mucosal epithelium [A19235].

During such contraction processes, ATP molecules are depleted as they undergo hydrolysis reactions and become adenosine diphosphate (ADP). To maintain homeostasis in muscle activity, the ATP supply of muscles must be regenerated regularly.

Phosphocreatine occurs naturally within the body and is capable of regenerating ATP by transferring a high-energy phosphate from itself to ADP, resulting in the formation of ATP and creatine. This kind of regeneration of ATP with phosphocreatine typically occurs within seconds of intense muscular or neuronal effort, acting as a quickly accessible reserve of high-energy phosphates for the recycling of ATP in body muscle tissues. ATP recycling from phosphocreatine is in fact known as the quickest form of ATP regeneration."

In comparison, mutant forms of IDH2 enzyme mediates a neomorphic activity and catalyze reduction of α-KG to the (R) enantiomer of 2-hydroxyglutarate, which is associated with DNA and histone hypermethylation, altered gene expression and blocked cellular differentiation of hematopoietic progenitor cells [A20344]. Enasidenib primarily targets the mutant IDH2 variants R140Q, R172S, and R172K with higher potency than the wild type enzyme form [FDA Label]. Inhibition of the enzyme leads to decreased levels of 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG) and promotion of proper differentiation and clonal proliferation of cells of the myeloid lineage [A20345]. "

These multifunctional proteins, including NS3, are essential for viral replication. The N-terminal of NS3 protein confers serine protease activity, whileThe C-terminus of NS3 encodes a DExH/D-box RNA helicase which hydyolyzes NTP as an energy source to unwind double-stranded RNA in a 3′ to 5′ direction during replication of viral genomic RNA [A20376]. NS4A is a cofactor for NS3 that directs the localization of NS3 and modulates its enzymatic activities [A20376]. Glecaprevir disrupts the intracellular processes of the viral life cycle through inhibiting the NS3/4A protease activity of cleaving downstream junctions of HCV polypeptide and proteolytic processing of mature structural proteins [A20376].
