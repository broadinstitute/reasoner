The collaboration produced a synthetic molecule which was given the name epoprostenol. But like native prostacyclin, the structure of the epoprostenol molecule proved to be unstable in solution, prone to rapid degradation. This presented a challenge for both in vitro experiments and clinical applications. To overcome this challenge, the research team that discovered prostacyclin was determined to continue the research in an attempt to build upon the success they had seen with the prototype molecule. The research team synthesized nearly 1,000 analogs.","Treprostinil (marketed under the trade names Remodulin for infusion) is a vasodilator that is used for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension. Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a disease in which blood pressure is abnormally high in the arteries between the heart and lungs. PAH is characterized by symptoms of shortness of breath during physical exertion. The condition can ultimately lead to heart failure. Treprostinil is a potent oral antiplatelet agent. The major pharmacologic actions of treprostinil are direct vasodilation of pulmonary and systemic arterial vascular beds and inhibition of platelet aggregation. In animals, the vasodilatory effects reduce right and left ventricular afterload and increase cardiac output and stroke volume. Other studies have shown that treprostinil causes a dose-related negative inotropic and lusitropic effect. No major effects on cardiac conduction have been observed. Treprostinil had high affinity for the Prostaglandin D2 receptor (DP1), Prostaglandin E2 receptor EP2 subtype (EP2) and Prostaglandin D2 receptor (IP) receptors (Ki 4.4, 3.6 and 32 nM, respectively), low affinity for EP1 and EP4 receptors and even lower affinity for EP3, Prostaglandin F  (FP) and thromboxane (TP) receptors. Treprostinil has demonstrated a unique effect on PPAR gamma, a transcription factor important in vascular pathogenesis as a mediator of proliferation, inflammation and apoptosis. Through a complementary, yet cyclic AMP-independent pathway, treprostinil activates PPARs, another mechanism that contributes to the anti-growth benefits of the prostacyclin class.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=27286723,"Description was created based on several sources, including: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3412595/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2515411/",tatiy@mail.ru,10/30/2016,RUM6K67ESG; 7JZ75N2NT6; H1FKG90039; 8GJK87S89F,81846-19-7,"2-[[(1R,2R,3aS,9aS)-2-hydroxy-1-[(3S)-3-hydroxyoctyl]-2,3,3a,4,9,9a-hexahydro-1H-cyclopenta[g]naphthalen-5-yl]oxy]acetic acid",22480736|22043212|21191432|20584221|20522807|20508873|20430262|20209098|20113497|19907722|19430571|18827901|18517170|18379976|18355483|18193114|18094217|17710235|17710111|17624303|17332729|17003851|16956486|16894408|16778286|16636723|16541195|16479971|16444463|16395422|16258596|16239641|16082422|15834459|15755791|15349141|15319815|15243302|15151467|15148531|15102871|15071612|14681345|14571286|12756943|12616965|12090728,6918140,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treprostinil,CHEMBL1237119,DB00374,http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2008/021272s009lbl.pdf,,FALSE,6432,pulmonary hypertension,FALSE,D006976,"Hypertension, Pulmonary",FALSE,REMODULIN,5/21/2002,Approved,http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/ob/results_product.cfm?Appl_Type=N&Appl_No=021272,,"Remodulin is a prostacyclin vasodilator indicated for: Treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) (WHO Group 1) to diminish symptoms associated with exercise.

PF-2545920 was originally developed by Pfizer for the treatment of schizophrenia. But later clinical studies for Schizophrenia were discontinued. PF-2545920 is a potent and selective PDE10A inhibitor with IC50 of 0.37 nM, with >1000-fold selectivity over the PDE. PF-2545920 is active in a range of antipsychotic models, antagonizing apomorphine-induced climbing in mice, inhibiting conditioned avoidance responding in both rats and mice, and blocking N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonist-induced deficits in prepulse inhibition of acoustic startle response in rats, while improving baseline sensory gating in mice.",http://adisinsight.springer.com/drugs/800025561 | https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19630403,"Description was created based on several sources, including https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19661377",anna@ranchobiosciences.com,1/17/2017,R9Y8EY0G42; TJ5KAZ8T5G,898562-94-2,2-[[4-(1-methyl-4-pyridin-4-ylpyrazol-3-yl)phenoxy]methyl]quinoline,21777010|20976216|20967473|20407482|19661377|19630403,11581936,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PF-2545920,CHEMBL1642569,,https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02197130 | http://adisinsight.springer.com/drugs/800025561,,FALSE,12858,Huntington's disease,FALSE,D006816,Huntington Disease,FALSE,Unknown,Unknown,Phase II ,https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02197130 | http://adisinsight.springer.com/drugs/800025561,,Unknown,Unknown,,Unknown,Unknown,,NCT02197130,Primary,ChEMBL,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19630403 | https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19661377,,,,,IC50,0.37,nM,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19630403,,Inhibitor

Estradiol-17-beta is the most potent form of mammalian estrogenic steroids. In humans, it is produced primarily by the cyclic ovaries and the placenta. It is also produced by the adipose tissue of men and postmenopausal women. The 17-alpha-isomer of estradiol binds weakly to estrogen receptors (receptors, estrogen) and exhibits little estrogenic activity in estrogen-responsive tissues. Estradiol enters target cells freely (e.g., female organs, breasts, hypothalamus, pituitary) and interacts with a target cell receptor. When the estrogen receptor has bound its ligand it can enter the nucleus of the target cell, and regulate gene transcription which leads to formation of messenger RNA. The mRNA interacts with ribosomes to produce specific proteins that express the effect of estradiol upon the target cell. Estradiol is used for the treatment of urogenital symptoms associated with post-menopausal atrophy of the vagina (such as dryness, burning, pruritus and dyspareunia) and/or the lower urinary tract (urinary urgency and dysuria).

It is a component of the combination drugs tegafur/uracil and tegafur/gimeracil/oteracil. UFT is an anticancer medication composed of a fixed molar ration (1:4) of tegafur and uracil. This drug is commonly used in the treatment of head and neck cancer, gastric cancer, colorectal cancer, hepatic cancer, gallbladder cancer, bile-duct cancer, pancreatic cancer, lung cancer, breast cancer, bladder cancer, prostatic cancer, or uterine cervical cancer. In the body, tegafur is converted into 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), the active antineoplastic metabolite. The mechanism of cytotoxicity of 5-FU is thought to be derived from the fact that 5-fluoro-deoxyuridine-monophosphate (FdUMP), the active metabolite of 5-FU, competes with deoxyuridine-monophosphate (dUMP), thereby inhibiting thymidylate synthase and subsequently DNA synthesis. Another active metabolite of 5-FU, 5-fluorouridine-triphosphate (FUTP) is integrated into cellular RNA, inhibiting RNA function. Uracil, when combined with tegafur, enhances the antitumor activity of 5-FU due to higher 5-FU concentrations in the tumor tissue versus normal surrounding tissue compared with tegafur alone. Uracil inhibits degradation of the released 5-FU.
